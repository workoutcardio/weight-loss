Fat is for survival and the body is willing to burn muscle in order to save up fat. I’m sorry….but the term ‘lose weight’ and ‘easily’ simply don’t belong anywhere near each other! By the end of the week, you’d have burned 2000 calories from your cardio sessions, but would have also consumed an additional 2450 calories, for a net gain of 450 calories per week. People usually then “end up eating an average of 100 calories more than they just burned off.”.
