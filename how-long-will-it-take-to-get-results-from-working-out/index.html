How Long Does PreWorkout Last in Your System? From thesupplementrank.com
Research suggests that engaging in a minimum of 30 minutes of cardio endurance training 3 times a week can increase your aerobic capacity between 8 and 12 weeks. Generally speaking, an average workout of 30 minutes, 4 to 5 days per week, could show results after 4 to 6 weeks. How fast you gain muscle depends on your genetics, diet, training approach, and factors like how much you sleep and manage stress. If you exercise for 30 minutes seven days a week, it’s more vital than ever to watch your nutrition and drink enough water.
