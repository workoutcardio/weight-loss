How to Improve Muscular Endurance Circulation Boost From circulationboost.com
Muscular endurance is typically trained by forcing the muscle to engage in resistance exercises for a sustained amount of time. During a workout, the muscles in the same area are stressed, and fatigue is the opposite. In other words, it is the ability to maintain muscle tension over time, which usually translates into a greater number of repetitions or longer isometric time performing a given exercise. Muscular endurance is the ability of your muscles (or group of muscles) to continually exert force against resistance or a given movement.
