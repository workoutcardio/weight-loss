Shortness of breath all of a sudden; The presence of serum anticardiolipin (acl) antibody without clinical symptoms does not support a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. When directed against cardiolipins, it can produce various.

<p>When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. High levels of the igm isotype are associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which an individual’s immune system attacks their red blood cells. The antibodies are igg (immunoglobulin g), iga (immunoglobulin a), and igm (immunoglobulin m). The antiphospholipid antibodies are the common antibodies for cardiolipin.</p>
