Shortness of breath all of a sudden; The presence of serum anticardiolipin (acl) antibody without clinical symptoms does not support a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. When directed against cardiolipins, it can produce various.

<p>When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. High levels of the igm isotype are associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which an individualâs immune system attacks their red blood cells. The antibodies are igg (immunoglobulin g), iga (immunoglobulin a), and igm (immunoglobulin m). The antiphospholipid antibodies are the common antibodies for cardiolipin.</p>
