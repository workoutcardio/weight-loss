What is the difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic Bacteria From proprofsdiscuss.com
The broad classification of bacteria as anaerobic, aerobic, or facultative is based on the types of reactions they employ to generate energy for growth and other activities. Bacteroides are some of the most common anaerobic bacteria species in the foot wounds of diabetics. Aerobic bacteria have catalase and superoxide dismutase enzyme. Aerobic bacteria are bacteria that can grow and live when oxygen is present.

<p>One of the most outstanding characteristics of these bacteria is that when environmental conditions become hostile, they generate spores in their cells. Anaerobes are the primary pathogens of wound infections. Many anaerobes infect open wounds, diabetic skin ulcers, bites, and other skin lesions.
