<p>Cardiac output is defined as the amount of blood pumped by the heart for systemic circulation in one minute. The study aims to proceed a literature review of defining characteristics (dcs) of decreased cardiac output (dco). Regulation of cardiac output includes autonomic nervous system, endocrine and paracrine signaling. Some methods are more invasive than others.</p>
