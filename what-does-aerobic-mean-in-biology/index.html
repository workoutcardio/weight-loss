They use it to metabolize sugars, proteins and lipids, but they also suffer oxidative damage, or breakdown of dna and other cell components, if they don’t get rid of it fast enough. Aerobic is the opposite of anaerobic.

<p>How does aerobic respiration work? Aerobic respiration breaks down glucose and combines the broken down products with oxygen, making water and carbon dioxide. In aerobic respiration, which is the process used by the cells of most organisms, the production of energy from glucose metabolism requires the presence of oxygen. Aerobic is a condition in which free oxygen or dissolved oxygen is present in an aquatic environment. Aerobic Respiration The Definitive Guide Biology Dictionary.</p>
