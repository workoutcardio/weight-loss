We conclude that the anaerobic capacity varies significantly between subjects and that it can be improved within 6 wk. Aerobic vs anaerobic training effect. During aerobic workouts, oxygen is flowing through the body and to the muscles which result in the production of more blood vessels (to carry that oxygen).

<p>Moreover, there was a close relationship between a high anaerobic capacity and a high peak. Anaerobic training specifically develops the two anaerobic energy systems and often develops power, strength and speed in the process. For example, if you incorporate strides or faster fartleks into your distance runs these can add an anaerobic training effect. Generally, these activities are of short length with high intensity.
