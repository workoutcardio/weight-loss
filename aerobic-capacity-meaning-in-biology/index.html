<p>The anaerobic bacteria definition does not require oxygen for its survival. It is a cyclic aerobic process taking place in the matrix of mitochondria to break down pyruvic acid into carbon dioxide in the presence of certain enzymes. This review focuses on laboratory measures which attempt to quantify anaerobic capacity; The vital capacity can be measured with the use of a spirometer, which can also separate the different components of the vital capacity.as seen in the following spirograph, the vital capacity consists of the expiratory reserve volume, the tidal volume, and the inspiratory reserve volume.the expiratory and inspiratory reserve volumes are the volumes of air taken in.

<p>Flight capacity is one of the most important innovations in animal evolution; Given that powered flight represents a demanding aerobic activity, an efficient cardiovascular system is essential for the continuous delivery of oxygen to the pectoral muscles during flight. The anaerobic capacity is the amount of energy that is obtained from anaerobic energy systems.

Exerciseinduced maximal metabolic rate scales with muscle aerobic.</p>
