<p>The anaerobic bacteria definition does not require oxygen for its survival. It is a cyclic aerobic process taking place in the matrix of mitochondria to break down pyruvic acid into carbon dioxide in the presence of certain enzymes. This review focuses on laboratory measures which attempt to quantify anaerobic capacity; The vital capacity can be measured with the use of a spirometer, which can also separate the different components of the vital capacity.as seen in the following spirograph, the vital capacity consists of the expiratory reserve volume, the tidal volume, and the inspiratory reserve volume.the expiratory and inspiratory reserve volumes are the volumes of air taken in.

<p>Flight capacity is one of the most important innovations in animal evolution; Given that powered flight represents a demanding aerobic activity, an efficient cardiovascular system is essential for the continuous delivery of oxygen to the pectoral muscles during flight. The anaerobic capacity is the amount of energy that is obtained from anaerobic energy systems.

<p>It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Functional impairment of any link in the chain can, to some extent, influence the decrease. Aerobic capacity is defined by the american college of sports medicine (acsm) as the ability to perform dynamic exercise that involves large muscle groups at a moderate to high intensity for prolonged periods.v̇o 2max is the most widely accepted measure of such aerobic capacity.
