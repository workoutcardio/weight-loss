It is the forgotten training threshold, overshadowed by its big brother, the anaerobic threshold. Among these are exercises that can be classified into movements that will require either aerobic or anaerobic capacity. Vo2 max per kg body mass in boys had a mean value of 59 ml. Linear regression analysis across biologic age revealed that in boys as well as in girls the vo2 max increased with increasing biologic age.
