Supervised resistance training appears to be a promising alternative exercise modality to supervised walking in patients with peripheral artery disease (pad). Both treadmill and resistance exercise training improved. Both resistance training groups performed 3 sets of 8 repetitions of exercises for 7 different muscle groups. Resistance training is an important component of a complete conditioning program for adults.
