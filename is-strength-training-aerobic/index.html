Strength Training and Cardio Exercise YouTube From youtube.com
There are several health benefits to aerobic training such as the strengthening of muscles involved in respiration, strengthening of the heart (this is known as aerobic conditioning) as well as a reduction in resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, and improved circulation. The reasoning has been that the aerobic exercise would reduce the benefits of strength training and vice versa. Aerobic and strength training, controlled by parameters of intensity, duration, and frequency, showed a greater improvement than conventional physical therapy in symptoms and cortical activity of pd patients, confirming the need for a systematic program of training with controlled intensity. This supposed effect has been called “muscle.

<p>For optimum results, aerobic training should be performed five to seven days a week for 30 continuous minutes each day. The reasoning has been that the aerobic exercise would reduce the benefits of strength training and vice versa. The two types of exercise differ by the duration and intensity of muscular contractions involved, as well as by how energy is generated within the muscle. In very untrained populations some modest aerobic benefit may be gained.</p>
