<p>However, if exercise training can be implemented early enough in life while cardiovascular plasticity still exists, then functional capacity can be maintained. Patients may begin to reverse the stiffness of the heart muscle and prevent the onset of diastolic heart failure. Bringing elevated blood pressure down to normal levels can help to prevent diastolic dysfunction from progressing to heart failure. Thus, microvascular dysfunction and inadequate coronary perfusion are likely mechanisms of diastolic dysfunction in aged rats.</p>
