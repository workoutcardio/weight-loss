In addition to lactic acid fermentation. This occurs in microorganisms, but is also a temporary response to oxygen. A type of cell respiration that takes place in anaerobes, and in which energy is released from glucose and other foods without the presence of oxygen. Anaerobic respiration occurs in human muscles and in red blood cells where there are no mitochondria.

<p>The anaerobic respiration uses other types of chemical elements or even more complex organic structures, through an electron transport chain. In this process sugar or glucose molecules undergo glycolysis and break into pyruvate. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Anaerobic exercise has multiple benefits for the cardiovascular system, muscles, and joints. Cellular Respiration is the process in which the solar energy stored in.</p>
