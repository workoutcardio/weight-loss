<p>The bacteroides genus is an example of anaerobic bacteria that is both beneficial and harmful. The nitrogen cycle bacteria in aquaria are lithotrophic; The substrate in an aquarium is an area where waste products are collected and broken down by bacteria, for planted tanks this is a beneficial process as it helps to release and store nutrients. Fine grain sand will develop an anaerobic layer at a shallow depth in as little as ¼ inch (6 mm) in depth. Anaerobic Conditions Good Aquarium Plants gibell Aquarium Society.</p>
