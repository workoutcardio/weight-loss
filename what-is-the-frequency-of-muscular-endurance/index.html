Performing multiple repetitions of an exercise may be a sort of muscular exercise, as is running or swimming. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle to repeatedly exert force against resistance. Muscles that lack muscular endurance tire easily and limit the amount of work those muscles can do and the pace at which you perform actions.
