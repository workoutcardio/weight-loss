Use of the fitt principle for muscular strength and muscular endurance will enhance overall: The ability to stimulate multiple muscle fibers is one of the critical differences between endurance and strength training. Muscular strength is the amount of force that a muscle can produce one time at a maximal effort, and muscular endurance is the ability to repeat a movement over an extended period of time.
