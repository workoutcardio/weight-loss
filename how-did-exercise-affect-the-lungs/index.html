Training also increases blood flow to a large extent, which enhances the area of the lungs involved in the exchange of gases. Exercises, or sports that involve running, swimming, and cycling affect your lung capacity, other sports may not have the same affect (banar, maura). The average person’s lung capacity can be increased by 5 to 15 percent (the effects of exercise on lung capacity). Consuming the right amount of food can help your body make use of the right.

<p>The overall volume of blood in the lungs rises by around 10 percent, allowing for the absorption of more oxygen for the heart to pump around the body via red blood cells. Lung function is not normally a limiting factor in exercise tolerance. As with many heart and lung diseases, the less active you are, the less you are able to translate that.
