<p>It can be low or high. Prolonged endurance exercise training leads to an increase in skeletal muscle microcirculation 31, and based on observation in rodents, it has been suggested that the rate of microvessel proliferation (angiogenesis) is faster in response to low intensity aerobic exercise training 44. Exercise has a profound effect on protein metabolism. The beneficial effects of regular physical activity on a variety of pathological conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes are undisputed ().these positive effects are most likely related to a number of adaptations that occur in skeletal muscle as a response to exercise training.

Aging is associated with a deterioration of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, primarily as a result of physical deconditioning, increased abdominal obesity (1, 2), and impaired insulin action in the skeletal muscle (3, 4).increased abdominal obesity with aging is a direct result of poor dietary habits and reduced physical activity, as well as genetic and hormonal.
