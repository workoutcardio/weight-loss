What to Expect Nuclear Stress Test • MyHeart From myheart.net
There are two types of nuclear stress tests, one that is used in conjunction with exercise (exercise stress test) and one that is used in conjunction with medication (pharmacologic stress test). Blockages can happen if you have coronary artery disease (cad), a condition where fatty deposits form in the blood vessels that supply blood to your heart.
