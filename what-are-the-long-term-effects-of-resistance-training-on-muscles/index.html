Resistance training here&#39;s why it&#39;s so effective for weight loss From theconversation.com
Maintaining good mental health is an extremely important part of life, and as we age, the foundations of emotional and mental stability learning through training. Many practitioners find that regular exercise helps balance their emotional and mental health too. Muscle fiber responses (1, 9, 14), neuromuscular adaptations (4, 6). In addition to the obvious effects of resistance training on muscle mass and strength, resistance training may lead to decreased risk for osteoporosis, fractures, and falls in later life.
