<p>Anaerobic threshold refers to a physiological process of the human body characterized by an increase of lactate (lactic acid) in the blood, which occurs during high levels of intense physical activity. Once you go above this intensity, blood lactate levels begin to rise. Aerobic capacity, also called maximal oxygen uptake, is characterized by the amount of oxygen the body produces and circulates to all major organs to regulate systemic homeostasis. The greater the intensity of exercise above the anaerobic threshold, the greater the rise in. What Does Aerobic Exercise Do For The Body Exercise.</p>

<p>Anaerobic threshold refers to a physiological process of the human body characterized by an increase of lactate (lactic acid) in the blood, which occurs during high levels of intense physical activity. The anaerobic performance, an estimate of anaerobic capacity, as expressed in the peak or mean power delivered over 20 or 30 s of maximal intensity, is lower in children and adolescents with cp. Once you go above this intensity, blood lactate levels begin to rise. The anaerobic threshold is the highest exercise intensity that you can sustain for a prolonged period without lactate substantially building up in your blood.

Faster speeds in covering a given distance would indicate higher anaerobic power or capacity, or both. The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. A person with a very high anaerobic capacity (36000 kj) can release 30 w over these 20 minutes (36000/1200=30w).</p>
