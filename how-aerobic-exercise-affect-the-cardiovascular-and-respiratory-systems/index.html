<p>Aerobic exercise has a systemic impact on the body and a local impact on the heart as shown in figure 1 (mann and rosenzweig, 2012). Exercise also keeps your heart healthy by reducing the risk for heart failure, valve problems and irregular heartbeat. The respiratory system provides oxygen to be transported through the blood to the exercising muscles as well as eliminating carbon dioxide. Effects of physical exercise on the cardiovascular system somebody with high levels of physical activity has a lower prevalence and lower mortality rates for the incidence of cardiovascular disease.
