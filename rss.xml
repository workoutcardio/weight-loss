&lt;p&gt;Breathability is crucial for intense activities, and as such, the shoe comes well ventilated with light mesh design. I wouldn&#39;t wear these on a day of heavy lifting, but they are perfect for hiit sessions. As well as dealing with the bad weather that often comes with exercising outdoors, it also means wearing shoes that are better suited to natural. When you’re doing hiit classes you need a stable shoe that will allow you to squat, deadlift, clean and snatch kettlebells all while still being light and flexible for box jumps and burpees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
