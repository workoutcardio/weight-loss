<p>Bacterial infections are common in dogs that come from rescue situations or spend a lot of time in boarding kennels where. Bacterial disease occurs when a dogâs immune system is weakened and the bacteria is able to replicate and spread in the dogâs body. Consequently, these bacteria often thrive in the mouth around the gums; In humans, these bacteria generally live in the gastrointestinal tract, but they may also be found in other places outside the body, including in the soil and water, in foods, and in animals.
