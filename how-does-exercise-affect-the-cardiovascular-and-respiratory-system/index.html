<p>As exercise intensity increases, greater demands are placed on the respiratory muscles, making them work harder on inspiration (inhale) and expiration (exhale). In older people, regular exercise is associated with a reduced risk of falls. Training also increases blood flow to a large extent, which enhances the area of the lungs involved in the exchange of gases. To meet this increased demand, the body responds by breathing deeper and more frequently in order to take in the necessary oxygen.
