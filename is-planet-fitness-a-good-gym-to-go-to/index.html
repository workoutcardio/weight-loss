<p>The best gym is one you're consistent at. In fact, most gyms in the franchise don’t have olympic benches or squat racks. Creating a facility that people feel that they can go to and not be overwhelmed is great. Between balancing work, family, and (of course) sleep — you only have so much time to spare.

<p>Planet fitness is a better choice if you travel a lot within the us, but world gym is a better option if you travel internationally frequently. Many planet fitness members do want to make progress of course, but the gym's own rules and operating guidelines seem to dissuade this. The best gym is one you're consistent at. Any gym that provides candy at the front desk, has pizza parties, and supplies bagels, does not have fitness and your best interest at heart.

<p>It lacks basic pieces of strength equipment and has strict rules about lifting weights. The college gym always has all the bars loaded up and plates and dumbbells lying all over.

<p>That means location is probably the most important factor. When my gym unexpectedly closed one night, i had the displeasure of making a trip to the nearest planet fitness to finish my work out. Unless you’re a beginner, a planet fitness membership isn’t worth it. They want their members to continue to pay them money for as long as possible.

<p>So i’ve told you how bad planet fitness is, but is it as bad as it seems? It lacks basic pieces of strength equipment and has strict rules about lifting weights. One of my friends currently has a gym membership at planet fitness and he's telling me how it's a really good gym and how they have free trainers with the black subscription (the $20/mo one or so). Planet fitness is a gym that doesn’t want their paying members to be fit. Gym in Stratham, NH 20 Portsmouth Ave Fitness.</p>

<p>One of my friends currently has a gym membership at planet fitness and he's telling me how it's a really good gym and how they have free trainers with the black subscription (the $20/mo one or so). I figured if i can get a good price and go to a good gym knowing what the heck i'm doing, then it would be worth it. I get the feeling that a lot of the people who discourage it are athletes or attempting professional endeavors.
