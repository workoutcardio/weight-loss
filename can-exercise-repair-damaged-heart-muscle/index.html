Singapore scientists discover way to ‘selfrepair’ damaged heart cells From connectedtoindia.com
In the exercise group, though, the number of progenitor cells actively dividing to form new cells and repair muscle damage increased sixfold. Once in place, stem cells help regenerate damaged heart tissue. The rate of regeneration is so slow, though, that it can’t fix the kind of damage caused by a heart. Chronic extreme exercise training and competing in endurance events can lead to heart damage and rhythm disorders.
