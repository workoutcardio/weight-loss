When used in relation to human development, the word domain refers to specific aspects of growth and change. It is widely acknowledged that the health benefits of physical activity (pa) are not limited to physical health. This chapter provides an overview of complex health behavior, including defining common physical activity domains in youth, such as active play and leisure activities, active transportation, organized sport participation, and physical education. It is widely acknowledged that the health benefits of physical activity (pa) are not limited to physical health.

<p>The aim of this study was to investigate differences in and the association between affective wellbeing and levels of different domains of physical activity at. There is growing evidence on positive effects of pa on mental health [1,2,3,4] and on a positive association between pa and mental health [1,2,3, 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14].however, the focus of research on this relationship has more. During this time, children develop motor reflexes and will continue to develop fine and gross motor.
