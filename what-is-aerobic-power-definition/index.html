What Effect Does Aerobic Exercise Have On The Body ExerciseWalls From exercisewalls.blogspot.com
Aerobic capacity , aerobic power , maximal oxygen uptake , vo2max. Aerobic capacity, also known as cardiopulmonary capacity, cardiorespiratory fitness, or vo2 max, is a measurement of your maximum oxygen consumption during physical activity. Aerobic means that the energy system needs oxygen to function. Increases hdl or good cholesterol.

<p>aerobic is defined as relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately. Decreases risk of heart disease. This means that the aerobic energy system relies on the circulatory system (breathing in oxygen) in order to create adenosine triphosphate (atp) for energy use. It also uses fats, glucose, carbohydrates, and proteins.</p>

<p>Aerobic means that the energy system needs oxygen to function. This means that the aerobic energy system relies on the circulatory system (breathing in oxygen) in order to create adenosine triphosphate (atp) for energy use. Itâs a reflection of your aerobic power and your bodyâs ability to keep performing under strenuous activity for longer periods of time. Glucose is known as a respiratory substrate, and is broken down by cells to produce energy in the form of atp. Aerobic anaerobic respiration.</p>
