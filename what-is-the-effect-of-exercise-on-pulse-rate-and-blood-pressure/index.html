To become more active, systolic blood pressure should be lowered.
Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) from 6 to 17 From researchgate.net
The more vigorous the exercise was, the more the change in pulse rate. Along with an increase in heart rate, the force of your heart&#39;s contractions also increases while exercising, so more blood is pumped with each beat. In my experiment i will be looking at how exercise affects the pulse rate of the individual. Thats likely because exercise strengthens the heart muscle.

<p>Changes in pulse rate during exercise and recovery are also discussed. From the analysis of the results, it was established that the exercise had resulted into an increase in blood pressure as well as pulse rate. This is because the bodyâs muscles require more oxygen to carry out aerobic activities than when the body is resting. Along with an increase in heart rate, the force of your heart's contractions also increases while exercising, so more blood is pumped with each beat.</p>

<p>This is a normal response to any kind of stress on the body, including exercise. It was found that during exercise systolic pressure rises and that diastolic pressure falls, the net result being very little change in the mean pressure. This effect increases blood pressure. Whilst doing exercise there is an increase in respiration, this means that the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood will also increase as the oxygen is used up.

<p>The increased rate of contraction can be measured through pulse rate or taking blood pressure. This is because the bodyâs muscles require more oxygen to carry out aerobic activities than when the body is resting. In a normal person, the heart rate and blood pressure progressively increase with progressive exercise. This, in turn, ensures good blood flow and normal blood pressure.
