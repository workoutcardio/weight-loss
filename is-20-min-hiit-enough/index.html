Researchers have repeatedly shown that people can burn comparable amounts of calories in hiit routines lasting, say, 20 minutes, compared to longer continuous exercise routines lasting, say, 50. However, you should note that the more intense your workout is, the more calories you burn. Overall, 20 minutes cardio on your cross trainer is enough to get a decent workout in and help tone your body, as well as assist in weight loss. My leg training is more intense than 20 min hiit.
