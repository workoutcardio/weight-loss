Plant vascular tissue is arranged in vascular bundles. Xylem and phloem are arranged in the same radius are called conjoint vascular bundle. The plant tissues transport water and nutrients that are pumped through the plant&#39;s whole structure, often against gravity. In a vascular bundle, the xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves and phloem transports food from leaves to all parts of the plant.
