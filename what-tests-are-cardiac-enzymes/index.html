Patients may also require the test if they are displaying symptoms of a blockage in one of the arteries of the heart. Your heart releases these proteins after a heart attack. This test has replaced other cardiac enzyme tests previously done, as it is more accurate. It includes three types which are myoglobin, troponin, and creatine.

<p>Cardiac enzymes are also termed cardiac biomarkers. Elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (cardiac biomarkers) in the blood are a sign of heart damage, stress or inflammation. In general, the more troponin there is in the blood, the more damaged the heart is. Although they are often discussed in the context of myocardial infarction, other conditions can lead to an elevation in cardiac marker level.

<p>A cardiac enzyme test is one means for assessing if a person is currently experiencing or recently had a heart attack. Although they are often discussed in the context of myocardial infarction, other conditions can lead to an elevation in cardiac marker level. Cardiac troponins t and i are the preferred markers for myocardial injury as they have the highest sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [ 1].
