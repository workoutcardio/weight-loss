<p>Congestive heart failure (chf) refers to the inadequate functioning of the heart muscle such that fluid builds up in the lungs, abdomen, feet, and arms (hence the term congestive). This causes the normally soft and stretchy arteries to become narrowed and hardened, resulting in a reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. The left chamber lacks the force to push enough blood into circulation. Cardiomyopathies are a group of diseases giving rise to congestive cardiac failure.
