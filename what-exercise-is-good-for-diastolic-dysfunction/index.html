<p>A exercise training program will be developed individually for each subject with the goal of increasing duration and intensity consistent with modern training techniques. The limitations on sodium in the mediterranean diet are likely sufficient to help accomplish this, but there also is a specific diet plan for tackling high blood pressure. Bringing elevated blood pressure down to normal levels can help to prevent diastolic dysfunction from progressing to heart failure. Thus, any diastolic dysfunction present at rest in chf during systolic dysfunction is exacerbated during exercise. Systolic vs Diastolic Dysfunction Physio Pinterest Psychologie.</p>
