Cellular Respiration Process From abcworksheet.com
These catabolic reactions result in the release of adenosine triphosphate (atp) and waste products. Glycolysis takes place in the cytosol, the citric acid cycle. Cellular respiration is a biological process in which cells convert sugar, amino acids and fatty acids into energy utilized by the cell. This process is known as cellular respiration.

<p>Cellular respiration is a series of metabolic reactions that occur within the cells of organisms (both plants and animals) to convert biochemical energy derived from nutrients to adenosine triphosphate (atp) and then release waste products. Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions that break down glucose to produce atp, which may be used as energy to power many reactions throughout the body.
