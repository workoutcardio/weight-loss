5 Really Good Reasons to Do More LowIntensity Cardio From pinterest.com
Why does low intensity exercise burn more fat? As you can see, while there was indeed a higher percentage of fat calories burned during the low intensity trail, there was a higher total number of fat calories burned during the high intensity trial (108 vs 96). You burn much much more energy much much more fat for fuel in the days after the workout because you increase your metabolism and you’re increasing this growth hormone. For example, when exercising at lower intensities (walking), you may be getting 70 percent of your energy from fat, but you may only be burning 5 calories per minute.

<p>However, the notion that low intensity exercise is the best way to decrease body fat does not make sense mathematically, nor has it ever been proven in exercise. Yes, your body does need a certain amount of oxygen to properly break down fat cells, and yes, your body generally receives more oxygen when you're exercising at a lower intensity.
