With cardiorespiratory fitness levels measured using a treadmill ramp protocol. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to working muscles during sustained physical activity, typically expressed as mlo2 kg − 1 min − 1, is often used as a proxy or an objective measure of physical activity [40]. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), defined as peak oxygen consumption (vo 2peak), reflects the interplay between the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and muscular systems in transporting oxygen from the atmosphere to the working muscles. D) ability of the muscular system to generate power during interval training.
