<p>Low to moderate exercise engages the “aerobic” metabolism and continues doing so as oxygen is available. The glucose can come from three different places: During starvation little respiration happens because little glucose is available. The increase in the respiratory rate and tidal volume in response to exercise leads to an increase in the pulmonary ventilation and thus greater delivery of oxygen to the alveoli to meet the increased demand of the exercising muscles.</p>

<p>An increase in the ‘respiration or breathing rate’ which refers to how many times a person completes an inhalation and exhalation every minute. In simple exercise involving large groups of muscles, as in walking on a treadmill or cycling on an ergometer, the efficiency of muscular. Remaining glycogen supplies in the muscles. Approximately after 20 secs minute ventilation increases exponentially and reaches the steady state central, medullary and peripheral chemoreceptors contributes to regulation.

<p>Respiratory response to exercise • respiratory changes occur rapidly, even before the initiation of exercise. This is similar to ‘heart rate’ in the cardiovascular system. The respiratory response to exercise. It also ensures greater removal of carbon dioxide which is produced by the increased workload of the musculature.

<p>By two minutes of exercise, the body responds to supply working muscles with oxygen. It then asks pupils to plan a practical about how the intensity of exercise affects heart rate and the length of time it takes for breathing rate to return to normal (link to oxygen debt). D) to decrease the supply of oxygen in the cells 9) when people are starving, they feel cold. Changes in ventilation during exercise the po 2 of arterial blood drops from 40mm to &lt;25mm hg blood.
