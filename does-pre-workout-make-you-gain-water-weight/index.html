Does Pre Workout Make you Gain Weight? Organic Body Detox From organicbodydetox.com
This is often because of the caffeine content. Typically, you can expect a 1.2% bodyweight increase due to water weight when taking creatine [9].

Creatine causes water retention, which gives you a bloated appearance.
