TRANSCRIPTION From biosiva.50webs.org
Reverse transcriptase does not have any proofreading capabilities, meaning it creates a significant amount of errors in the cdna it produces. The viral rna genome enters the cytoplasm as part of a nucleoprotein complex that has not been well characterized. Translation, the synthesis of protein from rna. In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform a wide variety of the functions of a cell.
