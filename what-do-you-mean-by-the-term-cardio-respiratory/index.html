Technically, cardiac arrest means that the heart has stopped beating, but it&#39;s really assessed by the fact that blood flow is no longer detectable, even if the heart might still be trying to beat. It is the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to the skeletal muscles during any sustained physical activity. Heart (the hollow muscular organ located behind the sternum and between the lungs; Cardiorespiratory fitness is how well the body processes oxygen.
