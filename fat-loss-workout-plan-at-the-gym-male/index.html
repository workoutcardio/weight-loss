As promised, here is a workout plan that you can use to get you through the weeks as you make your way to a faster way to fat loss. Exercises 2a through 2d are done as a complex, so choose one pair of dumbbells and use them for each move. You&#39;ll alternate between doing a week of heavy weights and low repetitions, in order to build muscle, and low weights with high repetitions to burn. Choose a type of cardio that you enjoy the most.
