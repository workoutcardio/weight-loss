Plants by Lily Parker From haikudeck.com
The two types of vascular tissue are xylem and phloem. The vascular tissue system is composed of two different types of tissues: The xylem is a complex tissue containing a range of cell types including: Xylem tissue moved water and materials dissolved in it from roots to leaves.

<p>The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. Xylem is to take the water from the root system to the leaves, and phloem is to take the food from the source (being the area of photosynthesis or storage) to all other parts of the plant. The two types of vascular tissue, xylem and phloem, are responsible for moving water, minerals, and the products of photosynthesis throughout the plant. Xylem, which conducts water and nutrients up from the roots, and phloem, which distributes food from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
