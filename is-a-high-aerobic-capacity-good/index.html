<p>Therefore, the determination of vo2max is of special importance as it plays. The difference between the two is that aerobic capacity depends on oxygen intake for the exercises to be performed. A lower time generally indicates better aerobic fitness, and a higher time suggests a need for. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp).
