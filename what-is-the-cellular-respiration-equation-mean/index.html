Respiration can mean breathing or turning food into energy, depending on the level of organization. This overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps among which few are redox reactions. The cellular respiration equation for glycolysis is as follows: C6h12o6 &#43; 6o2 → 6co2 &#43; 6h2o &#43; energy glucose &#43; oxygen → carbon dioxide &#43; water &#43; energy.

<p>All organisms respire in order to release energy to fuel their living processes. Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (atp), and then release waste products. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells in plants and animals break down sugar and turn it into energy, which is then used to perform work at the cellular level. Cellular respiration.</p>
