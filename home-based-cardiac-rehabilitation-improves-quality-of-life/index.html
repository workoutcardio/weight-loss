Exercise tolerance and cardiac output have a major impact on the quality of life (qol) of patients experiencing heart failure (hf). The objective of this systematic review was to explore the effects of cardiac rehabilitation interventions on the quality of life of patients with coronary heart disease with a specific focus on interventions that could be delivered within the context of a publicly funded health service. Home‐based cardiac rehabilitation improves quality of life, aerobic capacity, and readmission rates in patients with chronic heart failure.

<p>Cardiac rehabilitation is a cost effective intervention for chd that improves functional capacity and quality of life and furthermore has been shown to reduce acute hospital admissions ( hedback et al., 2001) and can therefore make a valuable contribution to the healthcare management of an ageing population. In the usa, cvd has an incidence of &gt; 650000 every year and is the most common diagnosis for inpatient admission in patients aged &gt; 65 years. The objective of this systematic review was to explore the effects of cardiac rehabilitation interventions on the quality of life of patients with coronary heart disease with a specific focus on interventions that could be delivered within the context of a publicly funded health service.
