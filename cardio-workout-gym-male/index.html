Keeping your muscles strong and lean helps to improve the way you look, your physical and functional abilities and also offsets natural muscle loss due to reduced testosterone and protein synthesis. Swimming is one of the best cardio workouts for men over 40, as it works every muscle in your body and is as strenuous as hardcore trail running without all the pounding on your body. Keep knees bent as you jump. Stand with feet outside shoulder width and turn your toes out 45 degrees.
