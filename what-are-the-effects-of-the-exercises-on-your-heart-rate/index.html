• hypothesize about the effects of body positions and exercise on heart rate. This happens because the heart needs to supply blood to the skin for cooling you down and it also needs to supply the blood to the working muscles. High intensity activities like sprinting, swimming and playing football involve several muscle groups working at a high rate, which elevates your heart rate. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time).

<p>If you have any medical conditions that may be aggravated by these movements, inform your teacher immediately. Aerobic workouts, especially swimming, train your body to use oxygen more efficiently, a practice that gradually reduces your resting heart rate and your breathing rate — two important indicators of cardiovascular health. If that were true, watching a scary movie would do the trick. A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm.</p>

<p>They recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise most days (or a total of about 150 minutes a week). This happens because the heart needs to supply blood to the skin for cooling you down and it also needs to supply the blood to the working muscles. The american heart association recommends that you do exercise that increases your heart rate to between 50 and 85% of your maximum heart rate. You therefore need less oxygen to produce the same amount of atp, and therefore have a lower heart rate as you do not require a higher blood flow.
