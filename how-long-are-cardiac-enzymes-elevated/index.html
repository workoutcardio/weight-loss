High‐Sensitivity Troponin I Levels and Coronary Artery Disease Severity From ahajournals.org
Cardiac biomarkers are proteins from heart muscle cells that have leaked out into the bloodstream after an injury to the cardiac muscle. Cardiac enzyme tests are a lagging indicator and can take hours to show up in the blood after a heart attack has started, he adds. There are a number of cardiac enzymes and the most common of these is called troponin. Creatine kinase and troponin are the two.
