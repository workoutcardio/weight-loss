Why Does Your Heart Rate Increase When Sick? From md-health.com
This process is measured by a term called “cardiac output,” which determines the amount of blood pumped by the heart in a given minute. As the amount of blood increased, the heart rate also increased to meet the demand for nutrients and oxygen. Meanwhile, your lungs will take in more air, making breathing more difficult. Why does heart rate increase during exercise?

<p>The sympathetic nerves will also stimulate the veins, causing them to compress. In order to reap the benefits of exercise, your heart and breathing rates must increase. The human body must pump blood throughout itself to provide oxygen and nutrients for the brain and other components for the human body to function properly. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles.

The breathing will increase to rid the body of carbon dioxide and to provide more oxygen, and the pulse will increase to provide the extra food and oxygen needed. Your heart rate will increase because blood is being diverted from your working muscles, and therefore, it has to pump. Your muscles are pushing your blood back to your heart at a faster rate, so your heart must increase its rate of pumping to match.
