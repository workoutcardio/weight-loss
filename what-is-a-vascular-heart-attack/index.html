Heart Attack Net Health Book From nethealthbook.com
A heart attack is a medical emergency. This is caused by irregular heart rhythms called arrhythmias. Coronary arteries supply blood to the heart and, when diseased, can block the flow of blood and cause a heart attack. The circulation of blood to the heart is necessary to oxygenate the blood, deliver nutrients to other cells, and remove wastes.
