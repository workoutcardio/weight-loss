As we can see, the main differences between aerobic and anaerobic exercises are duration, intensity, and above all, energy spent. The opposite of aerobic exercise is anaerobic and actually translates to ‘without oxygen’. Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while you’re training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy. Engaging in physical activity for longer than 2 minutes becomes more aerobic in nature.
