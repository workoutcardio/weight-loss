Biology Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration Jpablo From blogdjpablo.blogspot.com
Less energy is produced in anaerobic respiration. This process is same as the glucolysis of aerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration is an alternate mode of energy generation in which an exogenous electron acceptor other than o 2 is used in electron transport chain leading to a proton motive force. The body also has a mechanism to continue producing small amounts of energy without oxygen.

<p>Anaerobic respiration is a type of cellular respiration where respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen. The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. In the first step of the pathway pyruvate is decarboxylated to ethanal. A type of cell respiration that takes place in anaerobes, and in which energy is released from glucose and other foods without the presence of oxygen.

A type of cell respiration that takes place in anaerobes, and in which energy is released from glucose and other foods without the presence of oxygen. The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. In this process, glucose is partially oxidised to form acids and alcohol.
