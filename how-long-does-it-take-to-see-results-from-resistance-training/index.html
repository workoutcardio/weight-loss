Calisthenics vs Weights Which Is the Better Choice? This Is Why I&#39;m Fit From thisiswhyimfit.com
You may not see anything yet because your body is building up the base and not the bulge, but in 2 months you&#39;ll start to see your physique change and the muscles take shape while not exactly being defined yet. But there are some timelines set by the experts to see resistance band exercise results. Usually, resistance training by itself doesn’t have a large impact on shifting type i fibers to type ii fibers (1, 9), however strength training does result in an upward shift to type iia muscle fibers (fast twitch) (1, 9, 14) especially when run congruently with sprint training (14). Your starting weight and fitness/eating plan make a big difference as well as your genetics.
