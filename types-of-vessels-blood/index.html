<p>This amazing circulatory system includes three types of blood vessels — arteries, veins, and capillaries. Blood vessels are elastic, muscular tubes that carry blood away from the heart, transport it to the tissues and then return it to the heart. Humans, along with many other animals, have a closed circulatory system. Arteries and arterioles have thicker walls than veins and venules because they are closer to the heart and receive blood that is surging at a far greater pressure (figure 2).

A capillary connects an arteriole (small artery) to a venule (small vein) to form a network of blood vessels in almost all parts of the body. There are five types of blood vessels: Capillaries consist of one layer of endothelium and its concordant basement membrane. Types of blood vessels Part.1 YouTube.</p>
