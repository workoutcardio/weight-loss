This implies that the body requires more oxygen which must be supplied through the lungs. Exercises on forced vital capacity in sedentary women. In general, regular exercise has no significant effect on pulmonary function measures such as total lung capacity (tlc), which is the volume of air in the lungs after taking the largest breath possible, and forced vital capacity (fvc), which is the amount of air able to be blown out after taking the largest breath possible (fvc). As a result, your breathing rate increases to bring in more oxygen and your heart rate increases to pump the oxygenated blood throughout your body.
