<p>Cellular respiration begins by breaking down sugars known as glucose during a process called glycolysis. The series of metabolic processes by which living cells produce energy. Cellular respiration is a biological process in which cells convert sugar, amino acids and fatty acids into energy utilized by the cell. The process plays an essential role in maintaining the biological functions of all living cells. Why doesn't MATTER last FOREVER? Science with Mrs Pizzimenti.</p>
