<p>Cardiac muscles are made up of special cells called myocytes that can contract and relax by alternate phases. Cardiopulmonary function is the interrelationship between the workings of the heart and lung organs. The cardiovascular system is the method by which the heart and the entire network of blood vessels function together to direct the flow of blood through out the body. Hormones with cardiac actions can be synthesized and secreted by cardiomyocytes or produced by other tissues and delivered to the heart. Structure &amp; Functions of the Cardiovascular System.</p>
