Cardiorespiratory fitness is an expression of the capacity of the pulmonary and circulatory systems and can be assessed through measurement of maximal oxygen consumption (vo 2 max). To classify cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), we measure maximum oxygen consumption (vo 2 max). On the other hand, the 6mwt is a submaximal test that requires much less contribution from type ii muscle fibers. Thirty firefighters (85% male, 15% female), completed the submaximal protocol and the maximal.

<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness is an expression of the capacity of the pulmonary and circulatory systems and can be assessed through measurement of maximal oxygen consumption (vo 2 max). Poor cardiorespiratory fitness is previously reported in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia) measured both by maximal and submaximal exercise tests, but a submaximal exercise test with acceptable measurement properties is currently lacking for both clinical and research purposes in this patient population. Submaximal tests usually aim for just above 75% of the participant's predicted. Physical exercise as a means of rehabilitation for patients with cancer is an emerging area of research and treatment, emphasizing the need for accurate and feasible physical capacity measurements.
