<p>Aerobic exercise is cardiovascular conditioning that strengthens both your heart and lungs. For example, briskly walking, jogging, cycling, climbing stairs, swimming. However, neither aerobic or resistance training alone showed significant reductions in bp (p&gt;0.05).

<p>Muscle weighs more than fat tissue, so many. Aerobic and resistance exercise sequence affects excess postexercise oxygen consumption. We compared the effects of aerobic, resistance, and a combination of both aerobic and resistance training on cvd risk factors including peripheral and central bp, cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), muscular strength, body composition, blood glucose and lipids.
