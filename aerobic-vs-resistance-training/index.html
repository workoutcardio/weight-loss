<p>Muscle weighs more than fat tissue, so many. Aerobic and resistance exercise sequence affects excess postexercise oxygen consumption. We compared the effects of aerobic, resistance, and a combination of both aerobic and resistance training on cvd risk factors including peripheral and central bp, cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), muscular strength, body composition, blood glucose and lipids.
