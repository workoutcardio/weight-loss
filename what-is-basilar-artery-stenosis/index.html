Stroke mechanisms and of isolated symptomatic basilar artery From svn.bmj.com
The arteries most likely to be affected by stenosis are the internal carotid artery, the middle cerebral artery, the vertebral arteries, and the basilar artery. Intracranial stenosis is the narrowing of an artery inside the brain due to buildup of plaque inside the artery. Eventually, quadriparesis, dysarthria, altered level of consciousness, and ocular abnormalities may ensue and put the patient at great risk. It produces unilateral or bilateral pontine dysfunction and less often cerebellar, midbrain, occipital, or mesial temporal lobe ischemia.

The same symptoms are associated with vertebrobasilar insufficiency and can be caused by lesions of the intracranial va, basilar artery, or subclavian artery. The condition itself, which is frequently associated with concomitant basilar artery stenosis, carries a greater stroke risk than extracranial vertebral artery stenosisâsome 17 times the expected stroke rate of a normal population matched for age and sex.
