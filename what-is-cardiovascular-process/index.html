Your heart beats to the signals of the sa node and av node as the right atrium pumps it to the right ventricle. Cardiovascular responses to stress include increased catecholamine secretion, tachycardia due to elevated cardiac sympathetic and reduced vagal efferent activity, peripheral vasoconstriction in certain vascular beds, arrhythmia, and hypertension.
