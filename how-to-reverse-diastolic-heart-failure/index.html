These patients are generally diagnosed with diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Oh and if you are already an athlete, that can also be the cause but that involves a different set of criteria. As researchers search for the best. Diastolic heart failure, in which the left ventricle stiffens and bulks up, is different from systolic heart failure, in which the left ventricle becomes weak and flabby.

This condition is commonly referred to as heart failure or congestive heart failure in which a buildup of fluid around the heart muscle hinders the heart’s ability to pump blood.
