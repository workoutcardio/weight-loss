These patients are generally diagnosed with diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Oh and if you are already an athlete, that can also be the cause but that involves a different set of criteria. As researchers search for the best.

<p>Edema (swelling), especially in the legs, ankles, feet or abdomen. This condition is commonly referred to as heart failure or congestive heart failure in which a buildup of fluid around the heart muscle hinders the heartâs ability to pump blood. The study's purpose was to analyze the effects of exercise training on exercise tolerance and left ventricular systolic function and structure in heart failure patients with preserved, mild, and moderate to severe reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef).
