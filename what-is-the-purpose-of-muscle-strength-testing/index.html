Use of the Medical Research Council muscle strength grading system in From semanticscholar.org
There are college degree programs in kinesiology, but this science has very little connection to muscle testing or the art of applied kinesiology (ak). The science of kinesiology is the study of the mechanics of body movements. A good practical example of muscular strength would be your 1 repetition maximum squat or bench press, whereas an example of muscular endurance might be a 20 rep squat or a plank hold for as long as you can hold it with correct technique. Strength is the ability to carry out work against a resistance.
