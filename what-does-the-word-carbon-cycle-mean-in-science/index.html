Carbon is a major component in carbohydrates, fats and proteins. The carbon returns to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide as a result of respiration, decay by fungi, bacteria, etc., and combustion of fossil fuels. Maintaining this carbon balance allows the planet to remain hospitable for life. The carbon cycle on the land is called the terrestrial biosphere, all it includes all the living creatures living on the surface of the planet earth.
