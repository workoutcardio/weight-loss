Recent guidelines on exercise for weight loss and weight maintenance include resistance training as part of the exercise prescription. Few studies, however, have compared the effects of equal amounts of aerobic and resistance exercise (intensity of and volume of the training) on body mass and fat mass. Ten weeks of resistance training may increase lean weight by 1.4 kg, increase resting metabolic rate by 7%, and reduce fat weight by 1.8 kg. Fasting) and pp leucine kinetics, and.
