And inevitably, with age comes wear and. But that&#39;s not the only way you can, or should, increase your jumping power. Since the formula for weight loss is to burn more calories than you consume, increasing the calories you burn will help you lose weight (given you don&#39;t increase your calories). The national academy of sports medicine recommends lifting 50 to 70 percent of 1rm for 12 to 20 repetitions for endurance training (1).conclusion ultimately, changing load, repetitions, and tempo can all produce adaptations that can result in improved muscle endurance.
