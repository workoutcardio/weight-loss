People who have no equipment can still get an amazing workout at home— or in a hotel room, a park, or anywhere else you happen to be. Now by straightening your legs and keeping your feet together, keep them raising until they are just 45 degrees to the floor. Keeping your upper arms by your sides, your back straight and your core tight, bend your elbows and slowly raise fists to shoulder height, then slowly lower again. When you catch your breath and feel ready to go, start a new set.
