<p>In anaerobic treatment, bacteria convert organic compounds (cod) to biogas in an environment without oxygen. Anaerobic digestion is a sequence of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. In doing so, it reduces the amount of volatile solids by their conversion to a biogas (methane ch 4, carbon dioxide co 2 and water h 2 o). The biogas then demands further processing for recovery.</p>
