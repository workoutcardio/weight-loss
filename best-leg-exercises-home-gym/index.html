Here are some great exercises if you’re stuck with only dumbbells From pinterest.com
Place your hands on your hips and pull your naval in toward your spine. From a standing position, take a big step forward with one leg and lower your body until your rear knee nearly touches the floor and your front thigh is parallel to the floor. You might start by doing bodyweight squats or calf raises, and build up to more intense plyometric exercises, or lifting weights. Allow the weights to closely follow the line of your legs, and lower until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.
