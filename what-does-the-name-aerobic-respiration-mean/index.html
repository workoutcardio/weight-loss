It is a cyclic aerobic process taking place in the matrix of mitochondria to break down pyruvic acid into carbon dioxide in the presence of certain enzymes. Biology glossary search by everythingbio.com the process in which glucose is converted into co2 and h2o in the presence of oxygen, releasing large amounts of atp. Aerobic glycolysis is exactly the same series of reactions as anaerobic (fast) glycolysis, except it just has a different outcome because sufficient oxygen is present.
