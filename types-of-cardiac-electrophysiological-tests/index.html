The Human Heart Electrophysiological Data Visualization A Review From irispublishers.com
Invasive electrophysiological (ep) testing involves recording a por­tion of cardiac electrical activity and programmed cardiac elec­trical stimulation via multipolar catheter electrodes positioned percutaneously strategically at various locations within the cardiac chambers. In patients with syncope or episodes of palpitations and heart disease, an electrophysiology study (eps) may be of value by means of potential induction of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.[1,2] programmed ventricular stimulation may be useful in the context of risk stratification of ischaemic patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef). Natural electrical impulses coordinate contractions of the different parts of the heart. Upmc’s invasive and noninvasive electrophysiology laboratories provide the latest equipment for diagnosing and treating abnormal heart rhythms.

<p>This booklet describes the special tests that are commonly used to help diagnose heart diseases. The endocavitary electrophysiological study (also known by the acronym ees) is an invasive diagnostic test that evaluates the electrical properties of the heart and its susceptibility to developing different types of cardiac arrhythmias. Invasive electrophysiological (ep) testing involves recording a por­tion of cardiac electrical activity and programmed cardiac elec­trical stimulation via multipolar catheter electrodes positioned percutaneously strategically at various locations within the cardiac chambers.

In patients with syncope or episodes of palpitations and heart disease, an electrophysiology study (eps) may be of value by means of potential induction of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.[1,2] programmed ventricular stimulation may be useful in the context of risk stratification of ischaemic patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef).
