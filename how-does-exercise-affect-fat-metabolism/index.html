Here are basic factors on how aerobic and anaerobic exercise influence metabolic rate. During prolonged exercise, we see changes in a number of aspects of fat metabolism. Depending on the intensity and duration of exercise, different mechanisms are called on to make energy available. How does metabolism affect weight loss.</p>
