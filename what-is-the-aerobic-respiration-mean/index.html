Cellular Respiration THE PHYS ED EXPRESS From thephysedexpress.com
The process by which mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to atp is known as cellular respiration. Aerobic respiration occurs in most cells. The pmf is then used to drive atp synthesis. Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen.
