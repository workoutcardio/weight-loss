The cardiorespiratory system operates to obtain and circulate vital compounds throughout the body—specifically, oxygen and nutrients, such as food energy, vitamins, and minerals. Oxidative energy production is the primary means of atp production during rest and for activities that last for 2 minutes or longer. Cardiac output increases during physical activity due to an increase in. The heart and its muscular power drive the approximate 5.8 qt (5.5 l) blood volume through the entire distribution network (the cardiovascular system).

<p>Cardiorespiratory endurance is the ability to take in, deliver, and use oxygen. This means that the cardiorespiratory system can transport more oxygen and nutrients to different parts of the body more quickly, which is good news for athletes. The cardiorespiratory system is consists of the heart and blood vessels. Understanding how much oxygen can be breathed in per minute is necessary for training.
