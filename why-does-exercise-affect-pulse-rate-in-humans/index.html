<p>If that were true, watching a scary movie would do the trick. It allows it to pump a greater amount of blood with each heartbeat. During exercise, the heart must beat faster to eliminate excess carbon dioxide and increase the supply of oxygen in the body. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time).

<p>This will mean that the ph of the blood will also increase; Use the timers and stethoscopes again to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. When exercising our muscles contract more often and require more energy. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time).
