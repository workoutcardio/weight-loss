<p>Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while youâre training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy. When you run at an easy pace, your muscle cells have enough oxygen available to convert glucose into large amounts of energy (atp) with water and co 2 as the only byproducts. It can be good to think of aerobic and anaerobic exercises on a scale from âmostly aerobicâ to âmostly anaerobicâ, instead of a clear line between the two.
