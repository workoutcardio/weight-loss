Maximizing Your Cardio Workout From body-buildin.com
Cardio will definitely change your body shape from weight loss, although often this weight loss comes from both fat and muscle so essentially your proportions shrink. With weight training and body building, you’ll lose fat but you’ll also be building muscle, enhancing the natural shape of your body. My preference is, if i&#39;m doing high intensity cardio, i&#39;ll do abs first b/c i&#39;m too exhausted after cardio. Now you might wonder whether you should spend more time doing cardio or emphasize core work.
