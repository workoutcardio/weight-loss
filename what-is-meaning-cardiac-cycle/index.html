The cardiac cycle consists of the events in the heart from the start of one heartbeat to the start of the next. The cardiac cycle is essentially split into two phases, systole (the contraction phase) and diastole (the relaxation phase). The cardiac cycle is a series of heart contractions that pressurise distinct chambers of the heart, forcing blood to flow in one direction. The return of blood into the heart differs in arthropods from the.
