<p>Hiit is a type of interval training exercise. These heart rate spikes are the marker of a hiit workout. The heart rate will fluctuate around this value, but itâs a smart. My low intensity heart rate zone = 119 beats per minute.</p>

<p>To measure your heart rate, simply check your pulse. The premise of hiit is to push your heart rate up for a short period before taking a break for it to go back down. The target heart rate zone of a hiit workout is 80 to 95 percent of your maximum heart rate. High intensity interval training (hiit) is a period of high intensity exercise followed by a period of lower intensity exercise.

An example good use of your max heart rate is 30 seconds at 90 to 95 percent of your max, then 20 seconds at 65 percent of your max, then repeat, he says.

<p>High intensity interval training heart rate target zone calculation: A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. It incorporates several rounds that alternate between several minutes of high intensity movements to significantly increase the heart rate to at least 80% of oneâs maximum heart rate, followed by short periods of lower intensity movements.
