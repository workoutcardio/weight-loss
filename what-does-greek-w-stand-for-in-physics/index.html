<p>Seven wonders of the world. As you know the word physics is the greek word itself, now as what i do and believe should be taught in the schools is taking each greek word and cutting it up to explain the detail of each word. It is interesting to note that some physics symbols are very relatable (like “d” for distance) while some are unrelatable (like “c” for the speed of light). What does a w stand for the restaurant?</p>

<p>In this article, some of the most popular physics symbols are mentioned. Seven wonders of the world. It is interesting to note that some physics symbols are very relatable (like “d” for distance) while some are unrelatable (like “c” for the speed of light). Below is an elaborate list of the most commonly used symbols in physics with their si units. Headshots.</p>
