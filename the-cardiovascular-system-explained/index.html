Circulatory System Physiology Heart Lungs Simplified Explanation From youtube.com
The heart is a muscular pumping organ located medial to the lungs along the body’s midline in the thoracic region. Other parts of the blood like platelets and red blood cells help seal wounds with scabs to prevent additional bacteria from entering, and the antibodies in blood know to attack pathogens to. The arteries carry blood away from the heart; The cardiovascular system is the system responsible for delivering blood to different parts of the body.
