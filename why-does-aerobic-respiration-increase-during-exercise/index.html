Cellular Respiration From slideshare.net
During exercise our body needs more energy. Aerobic and anaerobic respiration plays significant roles when you exercise. The glucose can come from three different places: During exercise, your breathing rate increases, and you also take in more air with each individual breath.

<p>Why does heart rate increase during exercise? Minute ventilation (volume of air breathed per minute) increases by increasing the rate and/or depth of breathing. The reason why the breathing rate increases is because as the heart demands a higher supply of oxygen, the lungs have to work faster.
