Cardio and endurance training for hikers Trailside Fitness From trailsidefitness.com
Lifting heavy weights is an awesome way to strengthen your muscles, but it doesn’t do quite as much for your heart and lungs. Whereas a bodybuilder or someone training for strength outcomes may want to prioritize their lifting first and then do cardio after. If your goal is to get stronger and build or maintain your muscle mass, then you’ll want to avoid doing your cardio before you lift weights as it can decrease performance and increase your risk of injury. Lifting is anaerobic exercise, after all, because it’s too intense for oxygen to provide all the energy while lifting.
