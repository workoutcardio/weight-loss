<p>The definition of mean arterial pressure (map) is the average arterial pressure throughout one cardiac cycle, systole, and diastole. As blood is pumped out of the left ventricle into the aorta and distributing arteries, pressure is generated. Here are the steps for this calculation: Mean arterial pressure (map) is the product of cardiac output (co) and total peripheral vascular resistance (tpr).</p>

<p>Map is influenced by cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, each of which is influenced by several variables. To calculate a mean arterial pressure, double the diastolic blood pressure and add the sum to the systolic blood pressure. Changes in either of these parameters also influence map.
