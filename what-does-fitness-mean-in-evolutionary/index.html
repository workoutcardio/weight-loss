For biologists, fitness means an organism&#39;s propensity to survive and reproduce in a particular environment. Physical traits and characteristics allow species to survive. Evolution is natural selection, which means selecting an organism based on its fitness when a mutation helps an adaptation organism. Evolutionary biologists use the word fitness to describe how good a particular genotype is at leaving offspring in the next generation relative to other genotypes.
