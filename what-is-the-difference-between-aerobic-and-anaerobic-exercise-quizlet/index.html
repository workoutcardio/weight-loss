Aerobic Vs Anaerobic Respiration Diagram AflamNeeeak From aflam-neeeak.blogspot.com
What is the relationship between photosynthesis and aerobic respiration? Continuous ‘stable’ exercise is performed aerobically. Increased capacity to produce maximal force over repeated bouts (reps) increase rate of force development (power) 3 factors that determine strength. The main difference between aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise is that aerobic exercises depend on the inhalation of oxygen by the body as a source of energy.
