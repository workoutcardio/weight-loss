The effects of cold and exercise on the cardiovascular system Heart From heart.bmj.com
Describe the problems posed for the cardiovascular system by static forms of exercise. Normally, the heart rate will increase. The most popular hypothesis used to explain the initiation of cardiovascular responses to exercise is the ‘feedforward’ or ‘central command’ theory. Your blood pressure goes up as your exercise, but this effect is temporary.
