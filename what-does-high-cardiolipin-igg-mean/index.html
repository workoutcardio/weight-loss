If your igg blood test has high results: Lesser levels of igg and igm phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies and antibodies of the iga isotype may occur in patients with clinical signs of aps but the results. Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding. When antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can form.

<p>A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. When an increase in just igg is seen, then this is typically due to leukemia, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma. A negative result means only that cardiolipin antibodies are not present or not present at a detectable level in the blood at the time of the test. Antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake.</p>

<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. If all three immunoglobulins have high results, then this can be because of an infection, an autoimmune disorder, or inflammatory. I would like to know what having an elevated cardiolipin igm means. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages.

<p>Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them for just a short while due to an infection or drug, or present but without symptoms as a person ages. The immunoglobulin m (igm) antibody is the largest among the five major types of immunoglobulins and is the first antibody that is created by the body to fight infections. Cardiolipin antibody tests are usually reported as a positive or negative result. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting.
