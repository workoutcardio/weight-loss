Poor aerobic capacity can make it difficult to lifeder English From en.lifeder.com
Your capacity for something is your ability to do it, or the amount of it that you are. Aerobic capacity is a way to measure how efficiently the above scenario takes place. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). In this article, you will learn what the.
