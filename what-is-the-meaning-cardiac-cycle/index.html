“the cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. The cardiac cycle is essentially split into two phases, systole (the contraction phase) and diastole (the relaxation phase). An electrical impulse conducted through the heart muscle that constricts the atria which is followed by constriction of the ventricles; The (sinoatrial) sa node possesses the properties of automaticity and rhythmicity.
