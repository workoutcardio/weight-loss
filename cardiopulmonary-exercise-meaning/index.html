Our apps are nice too! However, under normal conditions pap does not rise. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is an exercise test for analyzing both diagnostic and prognostic assessment by evaluating both submaximal and peak exercise response involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, neuropsychological, and skeletal muscle systems[1], cpet is aimed at the evaluation of exercise performance, functional capacity, and impairment. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is the most comprehensive technique which allows a holistic approach to cardiopulmonary diseases.
