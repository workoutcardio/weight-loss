Are exercise intense enough to trigger lactic acid formation. In general, aerobic processes use the oxygen to produce more energy than anaerobic processes, but anaerobic processes release energy faster. While anaerobic exercise uses energy from muscles, aerobic exercise uses the energy stored in your. A study looked at the effects of interval training and exercising continuously at the same rate (at 60% max) on brain.
