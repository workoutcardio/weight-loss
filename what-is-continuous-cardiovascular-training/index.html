That is, during the activity, oxygen is heavily involved in the cellular reactions that produce the energy necessary to sustain the activity. Endurance training or aerobic training, involves working for an extended period of time (usually 10&#43; minutes) at a fairly low continuous intensity. Cardio is the same thing as ‘aerobic exercise’ aerobic exercise is one form of cardio training — but it’s not the only one. Running, cycling and swimming are all forms of cardiovascular training.

<p>Resting heart rate (rhr) as cardiac output at rest remains constant the increase in stroke volume is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in heart rate. It involves alternating the pace throughout your training, with phases of acceleration that increase your heart rate and active recovery phases.the idea is to be able to exercise for longer at a higher intensity thanks to the recovery periods, and to improve your cardiovascular performance. This is because there's a shorter but more intense period of work and each separate interval can be used as a mini goal within the training session.

<p>That is, during the activity, oxygen is heavily involved in the cellular reactions that produce the energy necessary to sustain the activity. Continuous training requires your body to use oxygen to produce energy which means it will improve your respiratory system (your lungs and breathing) and also your cardiovascular system (your heart). However, most studies show that cardiovascular training requiresa minimum of 30 minutes, 3 times a week to guarantee increased aerobic capacity in about 8 to 12 weeks. It is good for the heart and for the respiratory system, and most exercises are simple to replicate and perform. How Does Continuous Training Improve Cardiovascular Fitness All.</p>
