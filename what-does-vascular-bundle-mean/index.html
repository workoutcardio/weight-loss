<p>Definition of vascular bundle in the definitions.net dictionary. A structure of vascular plants that runs up through the roots, into the stems and out into the leaves, and whose function is transport within the plant. It is a strand of the particular vascular tissue of higher plants consisting mostly of xylem and phloem. The two elements of the vascular tissue are xylem and phloem.
