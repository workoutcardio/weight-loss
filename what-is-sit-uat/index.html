<p>User acceptance testing is the final stage of testing before the system is accepted by the operational user. To test the application for the correctness of how the application has been built and how its interface is been done. Sit is done after unit testing, but done before system testing. The sit (system integration testing) is intended to test the functionality of a system as a whole after integrating all the system components.</p>
