He circulatory system of birds is composed of the heart (four cavities, similar to mammals), arteries and veins that carry nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide,. This is necessary due to the high energy requirements of birds and mammals. Mammals contain a four chambered muscular heart, which has 2 atria and 2 ventricles.

<p>In mammals, as in birds, the right and left ventricles of the heart are completely separated, so that pulmonary (lung) and systemic (body) circulations are completely independent. Oxygenated blood arrives in the left atrium from the lungs and passes to the left ventricle, whence it is forced through the aorta to the systemic. Oxygenated blood comes to the left atrium and deoxygenated blood comes to the right atrium. The circulatory system forms a complex communication and distribution network to all physiologically active tissues of the body. what is a double circulation ? explain with the schematic diagram.</p>
