What are the Most Common High Pulse Rate Causes? From wisegeekhealth.com
The simple answer is that when you exercise your heart has to work harder to get the blood to your muscles. The actual numbers vary because everyones heart rate. Reasons behind increased heart rate when exercising. Heart ailments such as coronary heart diseases, hypertension (high blood pressure), pericarditis, congenital heart diseases, aortic regurgitation, etc., are likely to give rise to a higher pulse rate.

<p>Pulse rate is an indication of your heart rate as your arteries expand each time the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. To find your target heart rate, you can do a simple math calculation. When you exercise, you are making your muscles work harder. When a person exercises the heart rate otherwise known as the pulse will increase rapidly with the output of energy.</p>

<p>Fortunately, regular exercise is good at training. The human body must pump blood throughout itself to provide oxygen and nutrients for the brain and other components for the human body to function properly. The more you exercise, the easier it is to reach your target heart rate, which is up to 90% of your maximum heart rate.

<p>Your nervous system stimulates your veins to compress, eventually increasing your heartbeat or heart rate. Furthermore, just as there’s an increase in heart rate, there’s also an increase in the number of breaths. As the amount of blood increased, the heart rate also increased to meet the demand for nutrients and oxygen. As mentioned above, the heart rate or pulse rate increases and decreases to adjust with the body's requirement of oxygen at different times and while undertaking different activities. Exercise physiology from normal response to myocardial ischemia.</p>
