Below, cardiologist luke laffin, md, explains some key differences — and busts some common myths along the way. If your blood pressure gets too high, you could suffer from a range of health complications which include: The Relationship between Hypertension and Cardio Vascular Diseases.</p>
<h3 id="the-higher-your-blood-pressure-levels-the-more-risk-you-have-for-other-health-problems-such-as-heart-disease-heart-attack-and-stroke">The Higher Your Blood Pressure Levels, The More Risk You Have For Other Health Problems, Such As Heart Disease, Heart Attack, And Stroke.</h3><p>Caution should be used in patients who have diabetes with renal disease, cardiac disease and high blood pressure. As more alcohol is used (typically three drinks or more in one sitting), blood pressure becomes higher. Over time, it can damage your arteries if it goes untreated. Decreased renal function is associated with elevated heart rate, hypertension, and significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease.</p>
<h3 id="at-very-low-levels-of-use-alcohol-does-not-increase-blood-pressure--in-fact-it-may-lower-it-slightly">At Very Low Levels Of Use, Alcohol Does Not Increase Blood Pressure — In Fact, It May Lower It Slightly.</h3><p>A moderate coffee consumption means taking an average of 400 mg of caffeine a day. The american heart association explains how uncontrolled hypertension or high blood pressure can lead to damage to the coronary arteries, heart attack, heart disease, congestive heart failure, aortic dissection, atherosclerosis, stroke, kidney damage, vision loss, erectile dysfunction, memory loss, fluid in the lungs and angina. The excess strain and resulting damage from high blood pressure causes the coronary arteries serving the heart to slowly become narrowed from plaque — a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances. Habitual coffee consumption doesn’t mean you will be getting heart disease.</p>
<h3 id="the-pressure-can-reduce-blood-flow-to-your-brain-resulting-in-a-stroke">The Pressure Can Reduce Blood Flow To Your Brain, Resulting In A Stroke.</h3><p>When fats from the diet enter the bloodstream, they can collect in the damaged arteries. This slow process is called atherosclerosis. As your body weight increases, your blood pressure can rise. Under higher pressure, they’re continually forced to try to heal from the damage.</p>
<h3 id="the-issues-of-heart-rate-reduction-and-hypertension-control-are-magnified-in-patients-with-ckd">The Issues Of Heart Rate Reduction And Hypertension Control Are Magnified In Patients With Ckd.</h3><p>High blood pressure (hypertension) gradually increases the pressure of blood flowing through the arteries.
