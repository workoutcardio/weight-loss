<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is considered an integrated measure of function in multiple systems,. Maximal oxygen consumption reflects the overall cardiorespiratory fitness of an individual. Your doctor can measure cardiorespiratory fitness through what's called your maximal oxygen consumption (vo2 max) or from readings taken while you do an aerobic workout. It is the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to the skeletal muscles during any sustained physical activity.</p>
