<p>Conclusions— ventilatory response to exercise is abnormal across the spectrum of achd. A healthy resting heart rate is about 60 to 70 beats per minute, with cardiac output reaching up to 9 pints per minute. As exercise commences and cardiac output increases, blood flow is shunted from the organs of the body to.

<p>Individuals with suspected cardiovascular disease or any other type of disease that may produce an abnormal response to exercise should be appropriately screened and tested before the initiation of an exercise program. The cardiovascular response to exercise consists of a massive increase in cardiac output combined with a massive decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, predominantly of the skeletal muscle vascular beds. During aerobic exercise, such as running or jogging for instance, your heart rate can quickly reach 200 beats per minute, which also increases your cardiac output.
