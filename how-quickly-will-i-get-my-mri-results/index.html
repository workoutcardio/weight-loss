Whiplash who won’t get better. A new test reveals the problem cases From freshscience.org.au
If many images are needed for a detailed analysis, your mri will take longer than a scan taking fewer images. I know i’m going a bit mad waiting for the mri results which was 2 weeks ago tomorrow. The generated signals are then sent to a computer program that creates clear, detailed images that can find abnormalities in soft tissues, organs, and bones and joints. Depends on the hospital, part (s) of the body being scanned, how urgent the scan was requested, how the results were communicated, how busy the radiologists were, whether any abnormalities were identified, how long it takes for the secretaries to type up the letter, whether you had it as an inpatient or outpatient etc.

<p>How quickly do you get mri results? Mri scans typically take about one hour to perform. Thank you for posting on this forum, it. The radiologist may discuss initial results of the mri with you right after the test.</p>

<p>Some of the biggest factors include: I’ve asked friends and family and they agree. In addition, it helps to know who ordered the test. The results are “read” by a radiologist, and the turnaround time for their analysis depends on their availability and where the imaging study was done.

<p>Friends and family say to me that if it showed anything i would have heard by now. Why would an mri take longer than expected? If this is the case, oftentimes the doctor that ordered the test can interpret the test to an extent.

<p>I’ve asked friends and family and they agree. Just querying how long anybody who has had an mri recently has had to wait for results. Mri scans typically take about one hour to perform. The mri i had was also back quickly, going by the date on the report, but i wasn't asked to come in sooner than the appt i'd got two weeks later.

<p>In some situations, you may get your mri scan results back in as little as a few hours. Just querying how long anybody who has had an mri recently has had to wait for results. I had my scan at 730pm on a saturday night and had the results by 10am tuesday morning. So it's often the case that they have the report quickly or whenever the radiologist has written it up, but how quickly they actually contact you is probably more of an indication if that makes sense.

<p>I've now had the mri which was quite different to the previous one. The first i had to drink over a litre of water and this one was a complete fasting for 4 hours before the scan and an intravenous contrast dye. The results are “read” by a radiologist, and the turnaround time for their analysis depends on their availability and where the imaging study was done.

<p>If the mri test is ordered by a surgeon or a specialist, then there are many chances that the results for the mri test would also be interpreted by those doctors or surgeons who ordered for the mri test or for the mri scan. Uk if you are sent for any test, then as soon as the initial results are seen anything really bad is acted on immediately. If many images are needed for a detailed analysis, your mri will take longer than a scan taking fewer images.

<p>So it's often the case that they have the report quickly or whenever the radiologist has written it up, but how quickly they actually contact you is probably more of an indication if that makes sense. If this is the case, oftentimes the doctor that ordered the test can interpret the test to an extent. An mri can sometimes find a problem in a tissue or organ even when the size and shape of the tissue or organ looks normal.
