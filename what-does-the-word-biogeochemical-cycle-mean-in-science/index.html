Bio which means “life”, and geo , which indicates “earth”. Biogeochemical cycle, any of the natural pathways by which essential elements of living matter are circulated. Among these 40 elements, 6 are most needed and these 6 elements help in the formation of about 90% of the organism of plants, animals, and microorganisms. The passage of a nutrient through an ecosystem so that it eventually becomes reavailable to the primary producers.

The ways in which an element—or compound such as water—moves between its various living and nonliving forms and locations in the biosphere is called a biogeochemical cycle. Biogeochemical cycles involve both organic and inorganic substances, including water as well as elements such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and others.
