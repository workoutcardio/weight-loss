To conclude, every healthy adult should aim to do 150 minutes to 300 minutes of moderate exercise per week according to guidelines, this could count as going on a 30 minute to one hour walk each day during your lunch break or after work. I will suggest you following schedule. By exercising for 10 minutes with intensity and effort, you’ll be more likely to give your body what it needs to keep adapting, building muscle, and increasing your capacity. There is research that shows that 1 minute of intense exercise is as beneficial as 45 mins of moderate exercise.
