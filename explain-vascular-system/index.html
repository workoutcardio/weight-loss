<p>The vascular tissue system consists of a variable number of vascular bundles which are arranged in a ring in roots and dicotyledonous stems and are scattered in general ground tissue in monocotyledonous stems. The water vascular system includes a ring canal in the central part of the body. The vascular system, also called the circulatory system, is made up of the vessels that carry blood and lymph through the body. Vascular system consists of xylem and phloem.</p>
