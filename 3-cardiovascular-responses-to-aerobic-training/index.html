The study population included sedentary male subjects (n =. The cardiovascular response to exercise consists of a massive increase in cardiac output combined with a massive decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, predominantly of the skeletal muscle vascular beds. Aerobic exercise refers to the type of repetitive, structured physical activity that requires the body’s metabolic system to use oxygen to produce energy. Understand what happens to the body and how the body systems cope, (specifically the muscular, cardiovascular and respiratory systems), to the demands of activity/exercise.

<p>Aerobic endurance training requires people to have the proper progressions, variations, specificities, and overloads in order to have physiological adaptations. The result is tachycardia, an increased stroke volume, and an increase in blood pressure.

<p>Current public health recommendations are for adults to be physically active at a moderate intensity for 150 min or greater per week at a vigorous intensity for 75 min or greater per week or a combination thereof ().these recommendations are based on studies showing that exercise training improves various cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychological measures (). Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain how these responses are actually initiated: Aerobic/cardiorespiratory endurance training improves central &amp; peripheral blood flow &amp; enhances the capacity of the muscle fibers to generate greater amounts of atp.

An important part of the physiological response during endurance exercise is an increase in cardiac output (both the rate and force of heart contraction increase), and an increased delivery of blood to skeletal muscle. Exercise training with blood flow restriction (bfr) is characterized by the application of an inflatable cuff to the proximal portion of the limb aiming to decrease venous return to a muscle.the limited blood supply is an important trigger for muscle adaptations and, thus, it is a potent therapy to improve muscle mass, strength, and functionality even when it is.
