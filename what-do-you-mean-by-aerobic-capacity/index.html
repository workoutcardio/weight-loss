<meta name="description" content="30 Min What Do You Mean By Aerobic Capacity With ABS, This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). While there are a number of ways to measure aerobic capacity (more on this below), think of aerobic capacity as the volume of oxygen pumped through your body in a given amount of time.
What Does Aerobic Capacity Mean? And How To Improve It From homefitnessarena.com
Your capacity for something is your ability to do it, or the amount of it that you are. People usually stick to what they’re. You can boost v02 max through training, but there are still limitations based on genetics, sex, age, and body composition. Long distance running is a commonly used to improve aerobic capacity, even for sports that tend to focus on anaerobic movements.
