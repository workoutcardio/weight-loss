The american heart association recommends that you do exercise that increases your heart rate to between 50 and 85% of your maximum heart rate. This is fairly obvious for most students in my age group, but the next question asks them to determine the recovery time and compare how recovery times differ for individuals. C show the range of resting heart rate. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles.

<p>However, the blood vessels that supply your muscles dilate, or get larger, during exercise. â¢ hypothesize about the effects of body positions and exercise on heart rate. Along with an increase in heart rate, the force of your heart's contractions also increases while exercising, so more blood is pumped with each beat. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of exercise training on heart rate and measures of heart rate variability associated with vagal cardiac modulation and to quantify the relationship between changes in these measures.

They recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise most days (or a total of about 150 minutes a week). The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time).
