Will pokemon go count my steps on a treadmill? This means you can log several kilometers walking or running on a treadmill even though you’re in the same spot for the duration of the activity. It may not track biking, skateboarding, scooters, etc. When it comes to hatching, pokemon go does not track steps like a pedometer.instead, it measures the distance you&#39;ve walked;
