Aerobic Respiration YouTube From youtube.com
The key part of aerobic respiration is that it requires oxygen to occur. A catabolic process (see catabolism) occurring in cells where complex organic molecules are broken down to release energy for other cellular processes. In this process, a food molecule breaks down.
