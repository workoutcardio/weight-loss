Muscle energy technique (met) is a type of osteopathic manipulative medicine (omm) developed by fred mitchell, sr, d.o., in 1948, designed to improve musculoskeletal function through mobilizing joints and stretching tight muscles and fascia, to reduce pain, and to improve circulation and lymphatic flow. Muscle energy technique (met) is a class of manual therapy techniques used to improve musculoskeletal function and reduce pain. Technically speaking, what i am doing is using muscle contractions to pull my hip bones back into place, relative to my sacrum, or the base of my spine. An electrocardiogram, or ecg, is a record of the electrical activity of the myocardium, or heart muscle.

<p>Muscular power is the ability to generate as much force as possible, as quickly as possible. Skeletal muscles appear to be striated (or striped) because each myofibril is composed of a series of elements called sarcomeres, which are where the action is.the sarcomeres are placed end to end along the myofibril and contain two types of filaments: Electrically stimulated skeletal muscle represents a potentially unlimited source of energy for the actuation of motor prostheses. One is that the electrical current can recruit more muscle fibers to fire than when contracting the muscle normally.</p>
