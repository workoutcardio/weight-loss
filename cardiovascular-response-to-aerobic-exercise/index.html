<p>It is unclear why the mechanisms differ following resistance and aerobic exercise. Please consult vander sherman’s physiology for further reading 1. The cardiovascular response to exercise consists of a massive increase in cardiac output combined with a massive decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, predominantly of the skeletal muscle vascular beds. In order to change cardiac output, there may be a change in either heart rate or stroke volume. Aerobic exercise is a great way to work out your cardiovascular system.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the cardiovascular response to acute aerobic exercise is to maximize cardiac output and match the metabolic demands of the musculoskeletal system. The primary function of the cardiovascular system is to increase oxygen supply to the skeletal and cardiac muscle. This is not to suggest that both modes of exercise produce the same cardiovascular response, but to recognize that some aspects, such as reduced pressure, may be common in recovery from many forms of exercise. If the resistance is high, your heart has to pump against more force as the vessel wall is too tight and that raises blood pressure.
