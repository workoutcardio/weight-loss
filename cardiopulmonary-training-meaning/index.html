Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) definition cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) is a procedure to support and maintain breathing and circulation for a person who has stopped breathing (respiratory arrest) and/or whose heart has stopped (cardiac arrest). This causes the individual to lose consciousness and stop breathing, and it results in the body’s organs shutting down due to lack of oxygen.
