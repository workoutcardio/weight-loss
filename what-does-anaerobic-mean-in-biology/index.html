Anaerobic respiration is the process of producing cellular energy without oxygen. Enterobacteriaceae, vibrionaceae, and pasteurellaceae are the three major families of facultative anaerobic bacteria. Without oxygen the word anaerobic indicates “without oxygen.” the term has many uses in medicine. The facultative anaerobic bacteria are those bacteria that can survive and grow in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
