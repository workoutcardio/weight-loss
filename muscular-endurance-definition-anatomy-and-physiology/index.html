It is the opposite of fatigue. Endurance training is largely influenced by physiological factors (efficiency of energy systems, aerobic capacity/vo2 max, lactate threshold, muscle strength, power and muscular endurance). Fatigue is a relatively complicated. Discuss the physiology of strength development and factors that determine strength.
