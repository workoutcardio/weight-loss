It is the opposite of fatigue. Endurance training is largely influenced by physiological factors (efficiency of energy systems, aerobic capacity/vo2 max, lactate threshold, muscle strength, power and muscular endurance). Fatigue is a relatively complicated. Discuss the physiology of strength development and factors that determine strength.

<p>An endurance sport is any sport where there is a requirement to sustain an activity level whilst enduring a level of physical stress. Still, muscular endurance and cardiovascular endurance are linked. Local muscle endurance is best described as the ability to resist muscular fatigue and describes how a given type of contraction can be sustained, typically measured in terms of the number of repetitions. There's a whole host of [physiological] adaptations that occur that allow the muscles to do more work. PPT The Anatomy and Physiology of the Muscular System PowerPoint.</p>
