What are the differences between the cardiovascular system and cardiorespiratory system? Endurance cardiorespiratory fitness tests measure how long a person can walk or run on a flat surface without getting out of breath. The term cardiovascular uses the word cardio which means heart. Aerobic exercises can help promote heart and lung health and improve how well the body.
