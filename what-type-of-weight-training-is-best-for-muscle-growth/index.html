Muscle hypertrophy is a result, caused by the lack of adaptation on an energetic level. You can train in two different rep ranges; Cumulative fatigue training seems particularly suited to the needs of those seeking to add muscle weight for the above reason, for the fact that it offers a great change of pace from other muscle mass routine methods. For example, aerobic exercise such as running or swimming does not stimulate the larger motor units, whilst heavy weight/resistance training does which therefore leads to greater muscle growth over time.
