But if you’re doing both on the same day, you could actually be doing yourself a disservice. You can safely do some type of cardio every day of the week, but if you are also weight training then you are better off alternating days instead of trying to do cardio and weight training on the same day. It’s better to have a double session of hard runs and weights in one day and rest completely the next, than. And therefore, ideally schedule your running session 6 hours before weight training to perform in your best the next day.
