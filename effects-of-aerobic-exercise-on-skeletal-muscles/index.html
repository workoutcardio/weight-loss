<p>It can be low or high. The vast benefits of exercise and its ability to improve health in a wide range of populations are widely accepted. In this study we examined oxidative stress and skeletal muscle damage resulting from acute strength, aerobic, or concurrent exercise in rats. Aging is associated with a deterioration of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, primarily as a result of physical deconditioning, increased abdominal obesity (1, 2), and impaired insulin action in the skeletal muscle (3, 4).increased abdominal obesity with aging is a direct result of poor dietary habits and reduced physical activity, as well as genetic and hormonal.</p>
