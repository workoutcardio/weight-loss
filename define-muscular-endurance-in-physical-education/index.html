PE Distance Learning Muscular Endurance Dice Activity, Log, and Review From pinterest.com
Power is important in sport because it is a reflection of the body’s energy production, applied to generate. The definition of muscular endurance is a muscle or group of muscles’ ability to repeatedly produce force, with the key term here being repeatedly. Muscular strength is the ability of the muscle to exert maximal force against a resistance, whereas muscular endurance is the ability of the muscle to keep repeating force over time. It is the opposite of muscular strength.
