Cardiolipin antibodies are classified as autoantibodies that act against the body’s own cardiolipins. A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. Thrombosis and fetal loss is the main symptom for the reference of the anti cardiolipin igg antibody. A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested.
