In lactic acid fermentation, one molecule of glucose is degraded into lactic acid and energy. Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (atp), and then release waste products. The chemical change that takes place inside living cells, which uses glucose and oxygen to release. All organisms respire in order to release energy to fuel their living processes.
