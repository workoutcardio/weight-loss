<p>Easy to use and portable, study sets in cardiac sphincter are great for studying in the way. The pyloric sphincter is a ring of smooth muscle that connects the stomach and small intestine. The upper esophageal sphincter is a muscular valve that is located at the upper portion of the esophagus, which is typically about 8 inches long. The opening and closing of the sphincter is controlled by peristaltic waves produced by the stomach during the digestion process.
