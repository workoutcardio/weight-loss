<meta name="description" content="List Of What Does Cardiac Sphincter Do Ideas, One of the most important human sphincter muscles is the sphincter pylori, a thickening of the middle layer of stomach muscle around the pylorus (opening into the small intestine) that holds food in the stomach until it is thoroughly mixed with gastric juices. The upper esophageal sphincter is a muscular valve that is located at the upper portion of the esophagus, which is typically about 8 inches long.

Four main sphincter muscles along the alimentary canal aid in digestion: Sphincter muscle, any of the ringlike muscles surrounding and able to contract or close a bodily passage or opening. The role of the cardiac sphincter is to stop the flow of material back into the esophagus. The somewhat thickened muscular ring surrounding the opening between the esophagus and the stomach.

<p>Easy to use and portable, study sets in cardiac sphincter are great for studying in the way. The pyloric sphincter is a ring of smooth muscle that connects the stomach and small intestine. The upper esophageal sphincter is a muscular valve that is located at the upper portion of the esophagus, which is typically about 8 inches long. The opening and closing of the sphincter is controlled by peristaltic waves produced by the stomach during the digestion process.
