<p>If your results show normal troponin levels for 12 hours after chest pain has started, it's unlikely that your symptoms were caused by a heart attack. Troponin abnormality is set at the 99th percentile in the healthy population. Troponin results should always be interpreted within the context of the entire clinical presentation and combined with at least 2 correctly interpreted ecgs. Troponin tests are used, together with an electrocardiogram (ecg), in people with chest pain to see if they have had a heart attack, have unstable angina or have a problem outside the heart.

<p>If troponin results are above this level, it may indicate heart damage or heart attack. In a heart attack, a blood clot stops the normal flow of blood and oxygen to the muscle. As the tests become more and more sensitive, the absolute cutoff value for âabnormalâ has become lower and lower and the test has become less specific for myocardial infarction.
