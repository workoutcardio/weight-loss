<p>Aerobic fitness is measured during physical exercise. Aerobic capacity is commonly described by the o 2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity.</p>
