What You Need to Know About Anaerobic Exercise From verywellfit.com
Aerobic exercise is similar to cardiovascular conditioning or “cardio.” during cardiovascular conditioning, your breathing and heart rate rise for a long time. Anaerobic exercise is defined as short duration, high intensity exercise lasting anywhere from merely seconds up to around two minutes. Anaerobic means “without air,” and it relates to the body’s ability to generate energy in the absence of oxygen. In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise.
