The stem has to resist compression (squashing) and bending forces caused by the plant’s weight and the wind. Plant tissue sections monocot vascular bundle Flickr.</p>

<p>Vascular tissue is an arrangement of multiple cell types in vascular plants which allows for the transport of water, minerals, and products of photosynthesis to be transported throughout the plant. How vascular bundles originate in plants? The arrangement of the bundles is circular in dicots and scattered in monocots. The plant tissues transport water and nutrients that are pumped through the plant's whole structure, often against gravity. Xylem and Phloem A Plants Source and Sink Anna's Plants in Motion Blog.</p>
