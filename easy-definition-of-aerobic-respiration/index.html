All the information in our site are for educational uses. In the presence of oxygen, plants easily break down the glucose, and gases get easily exchanged from leaves, roots, and stems. In aerobic respiration, the glucose is the complete break down into carbon dioxide and water by oxidation. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from.
