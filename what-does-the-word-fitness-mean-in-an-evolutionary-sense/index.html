The ability of an organism to create offspring. In evolutionary terms, “fitness” refers to an organism’s ability to reproduce successfully or to have the potential to reproduce successfully — in other words, its ability to contribute to the gene pool of its species. Whichever you choose — or toss a coin for each blob if you like. It is relative to competitors in a species, it is relative to an environment, and it is a statistical.

<p>(10 days ago) evolutionary fitness is how well individuals in that population match the environmental conditions the population faces. An adaptation is a trait of an organism that increases. So if brown beetles consistently leave more offspring than green beetles because of their color, you’d say that the brown beetles had a higher fitness.

<p>Evolutionary fitness theory explains how modern organisms evolved from their ancestors over long periods. Fitness, in the sense of evolution does not necessarily mean the strongest, or fastest, or any other superlative.

<p>In evolutionary terms, “fitness” refers to an organism’s ability to reproduce successfully or to have the potential to reproduce successfully — in other words, its ability to contribute to the gene pool of its species. What does fitness mean in evolutionary terms? Certain traits will have been lost from the gene pool forever. Evolutionary biologists use the word fitness to describe how good a particular genotype is at leaving offspring in the next generation relative to other genotypes. .</p>
