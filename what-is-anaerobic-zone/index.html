But because burning fat happens too slow and requires a lot of oxygen.
Training anaerobic threshold Zone 4 &#43; YouTube From youtube.com
Effects of anaerobic exercise on your health. Training with both anaerobic and aerobic sessions will increase lean muscle mass and burn fat more quickly than one or the other. At this training zone the effort is very moderate and can be sustained for long periods of time. It is a very hard zone which can be kept just up to around 3 minutes.

<p>Anaerobic wastewater treatment is a biological process where microorganisms degrade organic contaminants in the absence of oxygen. Once you go above this intensity, blood lactate levels begin to rise. Training with both anaerobic and aerobic sessions will increase lean muscle mass and burn fat more quickly than one or the other. The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the bodyâs ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism.

<p>The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the bodyâs ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. In the anaerobic zone, your body produces energy instantly through the breakdown of glycogen stores. Once you go above this intensity, blood lactate levels begin to rise. The anaerobic threshold is the highest exercise intensity that you can sustain for a prolonged period without lactate substantially building up in your blood. 1.

<p>But as soon as you start to exercise, your metabolism kicks in and increases proportionally to your rate of work. Once you go above this intensity, blood lactate levels begin to rise. The objective of mixing in anoxic and anaerobic zones is to maintain optimum conditions for nutrient removal. A wider definition of the aerobic zone is from 40% to 85% of maximum heart rate.

<p>The greater the intensity of exercise above the anaerobic threshold, the greater the rise in. Here, all of the body's fuel sources have been used up and it becomes essential that oxygen is provided to the muscles for survival. The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the bodyâs ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism.
