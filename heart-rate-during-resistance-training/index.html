Aerobic training is defined as “an activity that uses the large muscle groups in a rhythmic fashion that increase the heart and respiration rates for a period of time…”. The figures are averages, so use them as a general guide. The other area of importance is the recovery rate and time to recover to a certain heart rate.

<p>However, resistance training activities such as heavy gardening can also lower risk for hypertension, lower resting blood pressure, improve cholesterol and decrease chronic inflammation. The acute cardiovascular responses to resistance exercise just described are in stark contrast to those seen during aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise is great for the heart, recommended as a daily activity by the national institutes of health.classic strength training is made up of slow repetitions of steady strength movements with plenty of recovery time between sets, usually two or three. Multiply your hrr by 0.85 (85%).</p>
