vVO2max The Velocity at VO2max (updated 2021) A key training intensity From training4endurance.co.uk
Aerobic training increases the rate at which oxygen inhaled is passed on from the lungs and heart to the bloodstream to be used by the muscles. Accelerate to a hard pace for 2 minutes. It represents the overall strength of the aerobic system and is the product of oxygen delivery (from the heart and lungs) and oxygen uptake (from the muscles). And run at a similar intensity — making these an excellent workout.
