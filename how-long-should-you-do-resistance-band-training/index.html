Resistance bands are lightweight, but very powerful workout tools, helping you make the absolute most of your time in the gym. Pull the resistance band up so the top reaches above your shoulder, with the band resting on the back of your arm (just like in your band squat). They are inexpensive, typically ps10, and can be bought from many retailers. I do think that you can use resistance bands all by themselves as long as you have a good diet plan and cardio routine.
