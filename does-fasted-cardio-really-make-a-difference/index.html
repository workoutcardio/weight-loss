Jemma Spowart Maxine&#39;s Challenge From maxineschallenge.com.au
A recent study from the uk published in the “british journal of nutrition” found that when subjects were fasted during morning cardio they burned 20 percent more fat than when they had a meal beforehand. But unfortunately, research hasn’t been conclusive on if fasted cardio is better than regular cardio for weight loss. No more fat is burned if you do cardio fasted compared to doing it after eating protein. Fasted cardio in the mornings allows for the possibility of increased caloric burn due to the increased effort the body is making by using stored fat as fuel for the exercise.

<p>Some research suggests that an 8 to 12 hour fasted cardio session may help burn up to 20 percent more fat. Fasted cardio in the mornings allows for the possibility of increased caloric burn due to the increased effort the body is making by using stored fat as fuel for the exercise. This concept has actually been put to the test by several studies and, ultimately, while fasted cardio does lead to a higher fat oxidation, it does not lead to an increased net loss 2 3 4.
