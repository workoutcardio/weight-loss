A robust literature supports enduring cpx test utility to assess hfref prognosis. The ability to perform physical exercise is critically related to the cardiovascular system’s capacity to supply oxygen (o 2) to the muscles and the pulmonary system’s ability to clear carbon dioxide (co 2) from the blood via the lungs.the cardiovascular and respiratory systems work together to provide both a delivery system (of o.

<p>A cpet measures how the heart, lungs and muscles respond to exercise. When used correctly, these data allow improved clinical decision making in patients with cardiometabolic and respiratory disease. The ability to perform physical exercise is critically related to the cardiovascular system’s capacity to supply oxygen (o 2) to the muscles and the pulmonary system’s ability to clear carbon dioxide (co 2) from the blood via the lungs.the cardiovascular and respiratory systems work together to provide both a delivery system (of o.
