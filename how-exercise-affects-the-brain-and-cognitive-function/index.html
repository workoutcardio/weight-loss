<p>Apart from losing weight, exercise brings about great results in the body and many of its multiple functions. This review argues that one reason for this knowledge gap is that exercise likely operates through multiple levels of mechanisms. This is because exercise has been shown to prevent the loss of total brain volume (which can lead to lower cognitive function), as well as preventing shrinkage in specific brain regions associated with memory. The brain is constantly changing, growing, and making new connections, and exercise helps to encourage these processes. Brain Health MDVIP.</p>
