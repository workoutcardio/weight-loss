Exercise physiology from normal response to myocardial ischemia From ecgwaves.com
The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen — about three to four times as much, to be exact. Heart rate is the number of times your heart beats in a minute. Regular aerobic exercise strengthens your heart over time. The american heart association notes that if you are calm, relaxed, not ill and are sitting or lying down, your resting heart rate is typically between 60 beats per minute and 100 bpm.
