<p>Glucose and protein can also be used as energy sources, but steady, moderate aerobic exercise actually encourages the use of fats for fuel. For anaerobic exercise, the muscles will use stored energy sources to fuel itself rather than oxygen, which includes breaking down glucose. It increases muscle mass and improves performance. During anaerobic exercise, the body relies solely on glucose found in the muscle tissue to fuel. Aerobic Vs Anaerobic Exercise Jpablo.</p>
