<p>Easy, recovery workouts must be done in zone 1. If you are racing in events that are longer than about 2 or 3 hours and shorter than about 6 or 7 hours you will spend a lot of time in zone 3.

There isn’t actually anything wrong with training in zone 3, so long as it is beneficial for the type of racing you’re doing. Because of this zone 3 fitness, moderate zone 2 riding (which is where 90 percent of any cyclists' training should ideally be), feels ridiculously easy. Doing a lot of zone 2 for recovery may well detract from your capacity to do the more valuable training above the anaerobic threshold.</p>
