<p>What is aerobic and anaerobic respiration class 7 science? Cellular respiration is the process through which cells generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). Both types of respiration are necessary for the cells in our bodies to create energy, but they occur in different ways. When the breakdown of glucose food occurs with the use of oxygen ,it is called aerobic respiration.</p>

<p>Aerobic respiration is a more efficient process than anaerobic respiration because it produces more atp per molecule of glucose than anaerobic respiration. In higher organisms, aerobic processes take place when cells generate energy from the oxidation of organic molecules which is a process that releases large amounts. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy.

<p>The differences between aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration include where the processes occur, what chemicals are involved in the processes, and what substances are produced by the two processes. The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is that aerobic respiration uses oxygen in the glucose breakdown process, while anaerobic respiration does not. It is the release of a relatively large amount of energy in cells by the breakdown of food substances in the presence of oxygen: Another key difference is the fact that higher organisms have aerobic respiration whereas in lower organisms anaerobic respiration occurs. biochemistry How does the body switch between aerobic and anaerobic.</p>
