WHAT IS CARDIOVASULAR TRAINNING? The Core Matrix From thecorematrix.wordpress.com
When we talk about heart rate training zones, what we are describing and measuring is the intensity at which your body is using its aerobic metabolism system to produce energy from fat and glycogen. The pace is comfortably hard, during which you can barely speak. This is consists of 80 to 90 percent of mhr. Exercise within 55 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate for at least 20 to 30 minutes to get the best results from aerobic exercise.
