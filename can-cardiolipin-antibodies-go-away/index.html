This test helps your healthcare provider diagnose clotting disorders and autoimmune diseases. It is recommended that positive results are confirmed after 12 weeks. Cardiolipin antibodies are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target the body’s own cardiolipins, substances found in the outermost layer of cells (cell membranes) and platelets. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is key to diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).
