Last winter i was on a long base training ride, and i felt generally awful. After the first 10 minutes press the lap button and press the lap button again at 30 minutes. The purpose of this experimentation was to measure the effects of intense endurance training on autonomic balance through a spectral analysis study of the heart rate (hr) and systolic blood pressure (sbp). A word of caution though, heart rate responds in a different way to strength training than to endurance training.
