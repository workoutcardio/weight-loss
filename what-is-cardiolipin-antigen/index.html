Cardiolipin antibody testing may be ordered when a patient has symptoms suggestive of a thrombotic episode, such as pain and swelling in the extremities, shortness of breath, or headaches. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur.

<p>Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ].
