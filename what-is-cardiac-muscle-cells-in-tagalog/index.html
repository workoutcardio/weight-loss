Muscular System The Cardiac Muscle (Heart) From slideshare.net
Cardiac muscle tissue works to keep your heart pumping through involuntary movements. Cardiac muscle tissue, also known as myocardium, is a structurally and functionally unique subtype of muscle tissue located in the heart, that actually has characteristics from both skeletal and muscle tissues.it is capable of strong, continuous, and rhythmic contractions that are automatically generated. Cardiac muscle cells or cardiomyocytes (also known as cardiac myocytes) are the muscle cells (myocytes) that make up the heart muscle. Cardiac muscle is an important part of the human body because it pumps blood through the body without it, a person would die.
