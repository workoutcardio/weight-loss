<p>The cardiac enzymes that doctors measure to see if a person is having a heart attack include troponin t (tnt) and troponin i (tni). They can be useful in the early prediction or diagnosis of disease. Cardiac biomarkers are proteins from heart muscle cells that have leaked out into the bloodstream after an injury to the cardiac muscle. At times the values of the cardiac enzyme blood test may rise or go down. Cardiovascular System Basicmedical Key.</p>

<p>Cardiac markers are biomarkers measured to evaluate heart function. This can include speeding up or slowing down what the body does inherently in order to actually get the desired effect.3. Elevations of cardiac enzyme levels should be interpreted in the context of clinical and ecg findings [ 1]. The test might also check for an enzyme called creatine kinase (ck).

<p>They can be useful in the early prediction or diagnosis of disease. The cardiac enzymes that doctors measure to see if a person is having a heart attack include troponin t (tnt) and troponin i (tni). The biomarkers used back then are not clinically relevant today as more sensitive and specific biomarkers have replaced them. Basically lack of oxygenation (ischemia) to cardiac muscles is the cause for rise in enzymes. PPT Cardiac Enzymes PowerPoint Presentation, free download ID3727394.</p>
