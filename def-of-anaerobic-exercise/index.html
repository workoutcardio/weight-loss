When the body is resting, the body is quickly trying to get oxygen into the muscles to nourish, repair and clear the waste products in the muscles. Increases bone strength and density: Anaerobic exercise such as resistance training and sprinting can significantly improve measurable quantities of peak strength and power, whereas aerobic exercise is primarily used to improve endurance (time to exhaustion) and total work capacity, as measured by peak oxygen consumption or caloric expenditure. The two types of exercise also have differences when it comes to benefits.
