<p>Anaerobic digestion is a biochemical process, it mainly utilizes substrates with high organic matter, such as sludge, domestic waste, sewage, and waste from a feedstock of cattle. One of the end products is biogas, which is combusted to generate electricity and heat, or can be processed into renewable natural gas and transportation fuels. For those that work in the wastewater treatment facilities across the country, anaerobic digestion is a term that is commonly used and understood, but for those that are less aware of what it means, hopefully this article can help. It is a valuable method of biodigesting organic materials, and it can replace the use of fossil fuels derived fertilisers. Fermentation Basic principles &amp; processes explained simply.</p>
