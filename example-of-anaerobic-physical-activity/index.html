physical activities of anaerobic Alactic system Brainly.ph From brainly.ph
Fast twitch muscles (as compared to slow twitch muscles) operate using anaerobic metabolic systems, such that any use of fast twitch muscle fibers leads to an increased anaerobic energy expenditure. For example, according to 2015 study in the sport journal, playing hockey includes both anaerobic and aerobic activity. Intense exercise lasting upwards of four minutes (e.g. If you go below your aerobic heart rate, you would be walking.

<p>If you exercise at a pace higher than a jog or run, you are sprinting, entering your anaerobic heart rate, and won’t able to continue very long. Some activities require a combination of anaerobic and aerobic exercises. Aerobic exercises like jogging, running, dancing and stepping exercises are designed to strengthen the cardiovascular and respiratory functions of the body. Anaerobic exercise offers a number of health benefits.</p>
