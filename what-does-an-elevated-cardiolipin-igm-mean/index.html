<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. The disease is characterized by decreased levels of immunoglobulin g (igg) in the blood and normal or elevated levels of igm. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Persistence is defined as moderate or high levels of igg and/or igm cl antibodies detected in two or more. Antiphospholipid antibodies associated with alcoholic liver disease.</p>
