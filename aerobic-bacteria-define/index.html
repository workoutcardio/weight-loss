Aerobic bacteria From ucsfhealth.org
When a culture of aerobic bacteria is going to be carried out in the laboratory, the first thing to bear in mind is that these types of bacteria require an adequate amount of oxygen. In this sense, the same atmospheric conditions are known to be ideal. They require oxygen for energy production. It can provide strict anaerobic conditions, constant temperature culture conditions and a systematic and scientific working area.

<p>An aerobic organism or aerobe is an organism that can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment. Bacteria which grow without o2, either by metabolic necessity (obligate anaerobes) or by preference (facultative anaerobes). [1] in contrast, an anaerobic organism (anaerobe) is any organism that does not require oxygen for growth. However, there are some bacteria that need extra aeration.
