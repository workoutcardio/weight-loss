<p>Recovery from exercise refers to the time period between the end of a bout of exercise and the subsequent return to a resting or recovered state. Intensity effects appear to be attenuated during recovery. This study systematically reviewed the available scientific evidence pertaining to the acute and chronic changes promoted by aerobic exercise (ae) combined with blood flow restriction (bfr) on neuromuscular, metabolic and hemodynamic variables. When your body does acute exercise oxygen increases to working muscles, a lot of changes must occur within the cardiovascular system that result in increased blood.
