Neurogenic and myogenic hearts From slideshare.net
The right atrium (auricle) receives deoxygenated blood and the left atrium receives oxygenated blood, which they pour into the ventricles. The rationale is that the impulse to beat comes. Myogenic refers to muscles or tissues that can contract independently of external electrical input, such as from the brain or spinal cord. Some animals, such as annelids and most arthropods, have an open circulatory system.

<p>There is a pacemaker of specialized cardiac muscles situtated in the right auriclular wall, also called sa node. Human heart is the the most complicated organ of our body. This is because heart muscle cells continuously depolarise without any external stimulus. Hence, it is known as the pacemaker. 6.2 H5 The Transport System PPT.</p>

<p>The right atrium (auricle) receives deoxygenated blood and the left atrium receives oxygenated blood, which they pour into the ventricles. Neurogenic heart is a sac or tubular in structure. The four chambers in the heart are responsible for carrying out this function. â¢ the heart beat is initiated by a group of specialised muscle cells in the right atrium called the sinoatrial node. 19.

<p>The myogenic heart is the intrinsic property of the cardiac muscles. Answers (1) because the cardiac impulse originates in the heart muscles, which is called myogenic. A myogenic heart is like a human heart. The nerve impulses in the heart are merely to regulate the natural beat of the heart. Vascular tone and tissue perfusion.</p>

<p>Myogenic means that a muscle is able to contract with no external stimulus. The normal heart activities are autoregulated by specialised muscles called nodal tissue. This is because heart muscle cells continuously depolarise without any external stimulus. It has a special type of muscle fibres called as cardiac muscles. Neurogenic and myogenic hearts.</p>

In fact, cardiac muscle is only found in the heart and makes up the bulk. Hence, heart transplantation can be done for myogenic hearts.
