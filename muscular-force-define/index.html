Muscular Force (Easy Definition) &#43; Examples in Daily Life From forceinphysics.com
Given the proper physical definitions and formulations involved in muscular power measurement, it is concluded that although strength (force output) and power (work/time) are quantitatively related, they remain separate physical parameters that can be measured in all dynamic muscular contractions, whether fast or slow. Magnetic force, attraction or repulsion that arises between electrically charged particles because of their motion. The human or an animal can move and do the work because of the muscular force that is utilized for every activity. Muscular force 2 see answers.
