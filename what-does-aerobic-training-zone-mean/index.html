<p>Aerobic training specifically targets the aerobic energy system and the cardiovascular system, which improves the delivery of oxygen to enhance its use. Aerobic exercise burns both fat and carbohydrates (also called glycogen) for energy. The anaerobic system delivers energy significantly faster, and will therefore deliver a greater part of the energy when the intensity is higher. Anaerobic means without oxygen, so don't be surprised if you are unable to speak except for short words at a time in this zone.</p>
