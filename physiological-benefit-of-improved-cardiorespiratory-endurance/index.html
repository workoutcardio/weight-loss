Physiological cardiac remodelling in response to endurance exercise From heart.bmj.com
If your heart is weak, you’ll only be able to exercise for a short time before getting tired. In short, cardiorespiratory endurance measures how well the body performs during long periods of exercise. To develop and maintain cardiovascular fitness, this exercise should be performed at a frequency of 3 to 5 days per week, an intensity of 60% to 90% hrmax or 50% to 85% hrmax reserve, and a duration of 20 to 60. Endurance exercise is any activity that uses large muscle groups, can be performed continuously, and is rhythmic and aerobic in nature.
