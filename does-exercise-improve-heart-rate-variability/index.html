By variations in the rr interval. Heart rate variability is also affected by such things as cardiovascular health. Exercise physiologist corrine malcolm explains the details and how endurance athletes can use hrv to improve recovery. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of exercise training on heart rate and measures of heart rate variability associated with vagal cardiac modulation and to quantify the relationship between changes in these measures.
