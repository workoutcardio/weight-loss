PPT Chapter 3 Increasing Cardiorespiratory Endurance PowerPoint From slideserve.com
What is an immediate effect of cardiorespiratory endurance exercise? Sensible diet, resistance training, and cardiorespiratory endurance exercise. High intensity interval training is performed in short bursts of maximum effort, followed by short rests, and repeated several times. Endurance exercise training results in profound adaptations of the cardiorespiratory and neuromuscular systems that enhance the delivery of oxygen from the atmosphere to the mitochondria and enable a tighter regulation of muscle metabolism.
