Endurance Workouts From makeoverfitness.com
For healthy shoulders and good posture, your middle trapezius, rhomboids, and rotator cuff muscles need to be active and strong, with plenty of endurance. Running might be your usual activity of choice, but you’re not doing your cardiovascular system or the rest of your body any favours by only running. This set of cardio workout routines incorporates a number of different cardio exercises like the elliptical machine, treadmill, and various calisthenics in order to dramatically increase cardiovascular endurance. Doing the same activity all the time can lead to stagnancy in your fitness routine, and it can also lead to repetitive stress injuries.
