The blood travels from the main artery to larger and smaller arteries and into the capillary network. Your heart keeps all the blood in your circulatory system flowing. The circulatory system plays a role in respiration and the transport of substances. The circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system, is a simple loop which starts, and ends, with your heart.
